/**
 * HANDING THE ORDERS TO THE COURIER.
 *
 * The batch screen already groups orders and marks them ready for pickup —
 * but that all happened here, on our side. Nothing was ever sent to the
 * shipping company, so nothing came back: no barcode, and therefore no way
 * to track a parcel, print a courier-recognised waybill, or match their
 * statement line to our order.
 *
 * The barcode IS the reference. We send them our order number as the
 * merchant reference; they answer with their barcode, and from that moment
 * the two systems can find the same parcel from either side.
 *
 * Three rules shape this:
 *
 *   NEVER inside a database transaction. A call to somebody else's server
 *   can hang for thirty seconds, and holding row locks on twenty orders
 *   while it does is how a warehouse stops working.
 *
 *   NEVER twice for one order. A second create is a second parcel at the
 *   courier, billed and collected twice, and the customer opens the door to
 *   a duplicate. An order that already carries a tracking number is skipped,
 *   not retried — and the skip is decided by a CLAIM WRITTEN TO THE ROW
 *   before the call, not by the snapshot this function read when it began.
 *   Two operators pressing «dispatch» on one batch used to read the same
 *   null, both create a parcel, and the second barcode overwrite the first.
 *
 *   ONE order at a time, reported per order. Twenty orders where three fail
 *   is seventeen parcels that must still ship — an all-or-nothing dispatch
 *   would hold them hostage to a bad phone number on someone else's.
