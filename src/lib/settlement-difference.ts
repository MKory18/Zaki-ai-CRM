/**
 * A DIFFERENCE AT MATCHING IS A QUESTION, AND IT HAS TWO ANSWERS.
 *
 * «عند المطابقة في فرق… ممكن عادي صار خصم، بس يعتمد رقم الشركة. وإذا غير
 * معتمد أنا رح أتواصل مع الشركة وخط اعتماد رقمنا، وهي بتعتمد رقمنا. بس بضل
 * الطلب معلّم.»
 *
 * Before this a mismatched line was a red row and nothing more. The reader
 * could see that the courier's figure and ours disagreed and could do
 * nothing with that: no way to say «yes, an agent gave a discount», no way
 * to say «no, they owe us the difference», and so the same argument was had
 * again at the next statement over the same parcel.
 *
 * The commonest cause is not theft and not a courier error. It is a
 * DISCOUNT: the agent on the phone agreed to take two off to save the sale,
 * and wrote it in the order's internal notes — where finance never looks,
 * because a note is prose and a statement is a number. That is why the
 * screen puts the notes one press away from the difference: the answer is
 * usually already written down by the person who caused it.
 *
 * ── THE TWO ANSWERS ──
 *
 *   ACCEPTED_COURIER — their figure stands. A discount was really given, or
 *                      the difference is small enough not to chase. The
 *                      money is settled at what actually arrived.
 *   OURS_STANDS      — our figure stands, and the shop takes it up with the
 *                      courier. The parcel is not settled at their number;
 *                      it waits for their correction.
 *
 * ── AND THE ORDER STAYS MARKED EITHER WAY ──
 *
 * «بس بضل الطلب معلّم.» Resolving a difference records what was decided; it
 * does not make the difference never have happened. An order that needed
 * this answer keeps saying so, because the count of them per person is the
 * whole point of writing it down: «في إحصائيات على هاد الشي».
 *
 * Pure: no database, no clock. It is handed rows and returns verdicts.
