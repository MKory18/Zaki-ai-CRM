/**
 * FOUR QUESTIONS, AND THE ONE THAT MUST NOT BE GATED.
 *
 * The analysis used to be a single list of rates, and a single gate above
 * it: under `MIN_SAMPLE` orders the whole screen said «not enough data».
 * That was right when every finding was a rate over a sample.
 *
 * It stopped being right when queues were added. «Three orders nobody has
 * pulled, the oldest since the day before yesterday» is a COUNT: it is
 * exactly as true on a store's first day as on its thousandth, and it is
 * the reading somebody most needs on that first day. Hiding it behind a
 * sentence about sample sizes is the analysis failing precisely when it
 * would have been most useful.
 *
 * So: rates stay gated, counts never are, and this file keeps the two
 * apart — because the gate is one line and it is very easy to put back
 * above everything.
