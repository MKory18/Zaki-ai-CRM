/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A MENU ARRANGED BY SUBJECT, WHEN THE WORK RUNS BY STEP.
 *
 * The owner, 21/10: «حاسو معجوق وصعب جدا التعامل معه … الخطوة يتودي
 * للثانية». The two parcels' roads that the whole product exists for — a
 * parcel from the shelf to the courier and back, and the courier's money
 * from his hand to the books — were filed as if they were lists:
 *
 *   • shipping was already in the order the work goes, but nothing said so;
 *   • the money was «collection, matching, custody», with the closing two
 *     entries further on — the errand read backwards;
 *   • the AI's configuration sat in the group of the thing it configures,
 *     which broke the contract's own rule (operations with the work,
 *     configuration in settings) — the WhatsApp inbox and its setup are
 *     already split that way;
 *   • «التطبيقات» was a heading you opened to find two links; and
 *   • «الخصومات» sat one row from «تنبيهات الخصم», two meanings of one
 *     root — money off a salary, and a price cut for a customer.
 *
 * Nothing here moved an address. Every screen is at the path it was at, so
 * no bookmark, no notification and no saved arrangement changes meaning:
 * the registry is keyed on paths and a layout is three lists of them.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
