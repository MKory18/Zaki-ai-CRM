/**
 * ONE CLOCK.
 *
 * Two endpoints used to time the same thing differently: the confirmation
 * performance route counted wall-clock hours, and the team screen and the
 * performance score counted WORKING minutes. One agent, one week, two
 * numbers — and nothing in the system could say which was right.
 *
 * Wall clock is the wrong one, and not by a little. An order pulled at
 * five on a Thursday evening and confirmed at ten on Saturday morning is
 * forty-one hours of somebody being slow by that reading. It is one
 * working hour. The difference is a weekend the company chose.
 *
 * So this is a structural test: no reader of a claim-to-action duration may
 * divide milliseconds into hours by hand. If a third screen ever needs one,
 * it calls the same function as the other two.
 */

/*
 * COMMENTS OUT FIRST. This read the raw file, so a route that MENTIONED
 * `claimedAt` while explaining why it no longer reads it was pulled into
 * the rule and failed it. A guard that reads prose is the defect
 * `ui-inventory` already names: «a census that counts prose is worse than
 * one that counts nothing».
