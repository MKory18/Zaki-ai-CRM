/**
 * WHAT A CHANGE REQUEST MAY TOUCH, AND WHAT EACH THING IS CALLED.
 *
 * One list, read by the route that accepts a request and by the dialog that
 * decides one. They used to keep a list each, and the lists had drifted:
 * the route accepted the city, the product, the offer and the notes, and
 * the dialog knew none of them — so four of the ten fields reached the
 * person deciding under their English code names, and three names in the
 * dialog belonged to fields no request could ever carry.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe: the dialog runs in the browser.
 */

/**
 * `regionId`, NOT `customerCity`.
 *
 * The city was free text and could not be applied at all: the order ships
 * to a REGION — the governorate the delivery fee is keyed on — and the
 * order route has no city field to write. So every request on it was
 * accepted, approved, and then refused with «عدّلها يدوياً»; it was
 * reported as «طلب تعديل: لا يمكن تعديل المدينة».
 *
 * The governorate is a real list and a real column, so the request can be
 * carried out to the end — which is the whole point of the door.
 *
 * AND `sellingPrice` IS HERE, WHILE `offerId` IS NOT.
 *
 * «كمية كم عدد والسعر الجديد… منتج آخر اختاره وكميته وسعره وينعكس هذا على
 * الفاتورة» — so the price had to become askable. The order route already
 * accepts it, so the request can be carried out to the end.
 *
 * The offer could not, and that was the city's bug wearing another name:
 * the door accepted it, a supervisor approved it, and the apply path then
 * answered «لا يمكن تطبيق العرض من هنا — عدّلها يدوياً». An offer is not one
 * value: it carries quantity, free units, price, discount AND whether the
 * price includes delivery, so applying one by copying an id would move five
 * money inputs at once through a path built for none of them. And the ask
 * behind it is already sayable in three fields that DO apply — the product,
 * the quantity and the price.
 *
 * A field belongs in this list only if `APPLIES_AS` in change-request-apply
 * can carry it out. A guard holds the two lists together, because this is
 * the second time they drifted apart and both times the seller found it
 * before we did.
