/**
 * AGENT CUSTODY — what a courier is holding right now.
 *
 * A shipping company sends a statement and we match it. An agent sends
 * nothing: he takes parcels from the warehouse, knocks on doors, collects
 * cash, and comes back. Between those two moments the company's goods and
 * the company's money are in his hands and nothing said how much.
 *
 * So custody is DERIVED from the orders he is carrying, exactly the way the
 * order state and the zone are derived — there is no custody column to fall
 * out of step with reality, and no second place to correct.
 *
 * Three questions, in the order anyone asks them:
 *
 *   ما زال بيده   — parcels shipped to him and not yet closed
 *   حصّله ولم يسلّمه — cash collected on delivered orders, not yet settled
 *   له علينا       — his delivery fees on those same orders
 *
 * The balance is what he owes us minus what we owe him. It is never stored:
 * the moment a receipt is recorded the orders behind it settle, and the same
 * calculation returns a smaller number.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DECIDE. The arithmetic lives in
 * agent-custody-totals.ts, which is pure and takes no database — because
 * «did anybody actually record what he took at this door?» is a rule, not a
 * query, and it was being answered wrongly here by a `??`.
