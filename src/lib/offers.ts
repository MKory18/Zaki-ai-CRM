/**
 * OFFERS — a product's bundles, and the one place their prices live.
 *
 * A landing page used to carry its own copy of the same three tiers. Two
 * copies of a price is one price too many: raising it in the catalogue left
 * the page selling at the old one, and nothing in the system noticed. So the
 * product owns its offers and every surface reads them from the product.
 *
 * What an offer says:
 *   quantity + freeQuantity — what the customer receives
 *   sellingPrice           — what they pay for the whole bundle
 *   compareAtPrice         — the CEILING on a struck-through "was". Display
 *                            only, and shown only as far as real delivered
 *                            orders support it — see price-honesty.ts
 *   endsAt                 — when this bundle stops being for sale
 *   discount               — a real reduction, the only one computeCod sees, and an
 *                            ABSOLUTE amount of money. It must stay below the
 *                            selling price it reduces — see the rule under the schema
 *   deliveryIncluded       — whether the price already carries the fee
 *
 * The separation between compareAtPrice and discount is deliberate. One is a
 * marketing number and must never touch the money; the other is money. Mixing
 * them would let a display decision change what a customer is charged.

/**
 * A DISCOUNT THAT SWALLOWS ITS OWN PRICE IS A TYPO, AND EVERY DOOR GUESSED.
 *
 * `discount` is an absolute amount of money, and it used to be bounded only
 * by a million — never by the price it reduces. So `sellingPrice: 25,
 * discount: 30` was accepted and stored, and the doors then disagreed about
 * what that bundle costs:
 *
 *   landing-page order (createPublicOrder)    0   allocateDiscount clamps to the subtotal
 *   cart quote                                0   the same clamp
 *   AI intake’s suggestion                    0   the same clamp
 *   AI intake’s WRITE                        99   `p.finalPrice || product.basePrice`
 *                                                 reads that clamped 0 as «absent»
 *                                                 and charges the base price
 *
 * One slip of the keyboard: three doors give the bundle away and a fourth
 * charges full base price. There is no reading that makes them agree,
 * because nobody designs a free bundle by writing a discount larger than
 * the price — they write `sellingPrice: 0`. So the row is refused where it
 * enters instead of being reinterpreted four times downstream.
 *
 * ONLY A POSITIVE DISCOUNT IS MEASURED. `discount: 0` means «no reduction
 * at all» and stays legal at any price, a price of 0 included: a free
 * bundle is a pricing decision, and refusing it here would be this rule
 * quietly making a different one than the one it was asked to make.

/**
 * AN EDIT THAT DID NOT MENTION A FIELD USED TO OVERWRITE IT ANYWAY.
 *
 * `.partial()` makes a field optional. It does NOT remove the field's
 * `.default()` — so in zod 4 every defaulted field came back PRESENT,
 * carrying its default instead of the stored value. MEASURED on an offer
 * stored as `quantity: 2, discount: 3, isDefault: true, sortOrder: 5`:
 *
 *     offerFields.partial().safeParse({ sortOrder: 1 })
 *       → { sortOrder: 1, quantity: 1, freeQuantity: 0, discount: 0,
 *           deliveryIncluded: true, isDefault: false, status: 'ACTIVE' }
 *
 * `PATCH /api/offers/[id]` writes `input.x !== undefined ? { x } : {}`, and
 * every one of those defaults is `!== undefined`. So dragging a bundle up
 * the list — `PATCH { sortOrder: 1 }`, the one edit the offers screen sends
 * alone — turned «قطعتان بحسم ٣» into one piece at no discount, no longer
 * the default, forced back to ACTIVE. No error, and nothing in the request
 * asked for any of it.
 *
 * THE DEFAULTS ARE REMOVED HERE RATHER THAN THE MERGE PATCHED THERE. A
 * route that compares against `undefined` is correct the moment «omitted»
 * actually arrives omitted, and this schema is the one place every door
 * reads — the edit route today and any caller written later. Patching the
 * route would hand the next reader of `offerPatchSchema` the same loaded
 * gun.
 *
 * AND IT IS DONE OVER THE SHAPE, NOT FIELD BY FIELD. A field added to
 * `offerFields` tomorrow with a `.default()` is stripped without anybody
 * remembering to strip it, which is the only version of this fix that
 * cannot rot. `offers.test.ts` walks every field of the patch schema and
 * refuses any that invents a value out of `undefined`, so a zod wrapper
 * this helper does not know about fails the suite instead of shipping.
 *
 * The create door keeps every default, which is right there: `POST` is the
 * row being written whole, and an unstated quantity really is 1.
 *
 * THE HELPER ITSELF NOW LIVES IN `zod-patch.ts`, NOT HERE. Three more doors
 * were found carrying the same defect — a campaign's spend, a store page's
 * text, a redirect's 301 — and this file is the wrong home for the answer
 * to all four: it is a domain module that knows about Prisma, while
 * `store-pages.ts` must stay client-safe. One implementation, no domain
 * attached, beside `zod-message.ts`.

 * whatever the request leaves out and the rule reads the values the offer

 * would shut the create door and leave the edit door open, which is exactly
 * how a rule becomes decoration.
 *
 * BOTH FALLBACKS ARE LIVE NOW, which they were not before the defaults were
 * stripped: an omitted `discount` used to arrive as 0 and the route wrote
 * that 0, so `{ sellingPrice: 2 }` against a stored discount of 3 parsed
 * clean and landed a row with no reduction at all. It is refused now,
 * because the row it would leave is 2 with a discount of 3.
 *
 * A function rather than a schema for two reasons: the stored row is not
