/**
 * WHAT A PERSONAL PHONE CAN AND CANNOT BE MADE TO DO.
 *
 * The staff open this on their own phones. Those phones leave the building,
 * get lent to a brother, get sold, and photograph their own screens. Most of
 * what people ask for here is impossible, and saying so plainly is part of
 * the job:
 *
 *   A web page CANNOT block a screenshot. Not on iOS, not on Android, not
 *   in a PWA, not with any CSS or JavaScript. There is no API for it and
 *   there is no trick that works. Even if there were, it would not stop the
 *   oldest method there is — a second phone, pointed at the first.
 *
 *   A web page CANNOT stop copying, retyping, or reading a number aloud
 *   into a phone call.
 *
 * So nothing in this file claims to prevent leakage. Each piece does one
 * thing that is actually achievable:
 *
 *   The WATERMARK does not stop a photograph. It puts a name in it, so a
 *   leaked screenshot answers "whose screen was this" without an
 *   investigation. That changes behaviour, which is the whole of the
 *   effect, and it is worth having for that alone.
 *
 *   The IDLE LIMIT does not stop a thief. It shortens the window in which a
 *   phone left on a counter is an open account, from the seven days the
 *   cookie lasts to the minutes somebody would have to notice it.
 *
 *   The AUDIT of bulk extraction does not stop an export. It means one
 *   happened in the open rather than invisibly.
 *
 * Everything here is a decision, not a drawing. The components read these
 * answers; they do not each invent their own.
 */

/**
 * How long a screen may sit untouched before the account is signed out.
 *
 * Twenty minutes is chosen from the work, not from a standard. A
 * confirmation agent puts the phone down between calls; a packer scans
 * every few seconds; a manager reads a dashboard for ten minutes without
 * touching it, and scrolling counts as touching it. Five minutes would sign
 * people out mid-shift and teach them to hate it, which ends with the
 * timeout being raised to a day. Twenty is short enough to matter on a
 * counter and long enough that nobody games it.
