/**
 * A CONFIRMED ORDER THAT IS NOT GOING OUT.
 *
 * Somebody at the packing table decides a parcel is not shipping. Either the
 * customer needs talking to again, or it is over — and until now the screen
 * offered neither. It had a HOLD, which keeps the order confirmed with its
 * stock reserved and sets `shipHoldUntil`: a field read by exactly two files,
 * defaulting to FOREVER, so a held order was invisible to everyone except
 * whoever opened the held view on that one screen.
 *
 * THE STATE MACHINE SAID THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN. `CONFIRMED: []` — terminal.
 * And the invariants say the opposite in as many words: «reservation is
 * released in the same transaction on CANCELLED, VOIDED, UNCONFIRM». The
 * concept was in the contract and the transition map had no room for it. That
 * is reported, not quietly widened: this one door does it, with its own
 * guards, rather than opening `CONFIRMED` to every screen in the product.
