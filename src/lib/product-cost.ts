/**
 * WHAT ONE UNIT OF THIS PRODUCT COST US.
 *
 * A product does not have "a" cost. It has a cost per batch: the run you
 * made in March at 3.20 and the delivery you received in June at 4.10 are
 * different money sitting on the same shelf. Every figure that calls itself
 * "the product's cost" is choosing how to blend them, and the choice shows
 * up directly in the profit.
 *
 * What was here read `batches[0].costPerUnit` — whichever batch the query
 * happened to return first. That is not a policy, it is an accident, and it
 * moved the reported profit of every order by the difference between two
 * arbitrary batches.
 *
 * Two honest numbers replace it:
 *
 *   The WEIGHTED AVERAGE of what is still on hand, for estimating the cost
 *   of an order that has not shipped. It answers "if I sell one now, what
 *   did it cost me", and it moves only when real stock arrives at a real
 *   price.
 *
 *   The CONSUMED cost, recorded when the goods actually leave, taken from
 *   the batches the draw-down emptied — oldest first. That is the figure
 *   that belongs in a closed order's profit, because it is the money that
 *   actually left.
