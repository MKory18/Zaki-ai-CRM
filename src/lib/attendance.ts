/**
 * WHO CAME, WHEN, AND FOR HOW LONG.
 *
 * Two records of the same day, kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *   PRESENCE is what the person says. The login is one mark of it and the
 *   "استلمت" button is another; both mean "I am here".
 *
 *   WORK is what the system saw them do — a claim, a decision, a call
 *   logged. It cannot be pressed and then slept through.
 *
 * Showing only presence lets somebody sign in and disappear. Showing only
 * work punishes the morning a queue stayed empty, or the afternoon spent in
 * a meeting. So both are reported, and the distance between them is the
 * thing a manager actually wants to see.
 *
 * LATENESS is measured against THIS PERSON's shift where they have one,
 * and the country's work hours where they do not — in the country's own
 * timezone either way. Somebody whose shift starts at noon measured against
 * a nine o'clock country is three hours late every day of their life, and
 * every figure built on that is wrong in the same direction. A day nobody
 * arrived at all is absent, not late: counting an off day as infinitely
 * late would drown every real figure.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored. Every number is derived from the marks and the
 * shift, so changing the work hours corrects the history rather than
 * leaving a stale column behind.
