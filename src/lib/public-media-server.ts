/**
 * WHOSE IMAGES ARE PUBLIC, AND WHEN.
 *
 * An image sits in the folder of the row it was uploaded for — a landing
 * page or a product (see public-media.ts). It is public:
 *
 *  - shown by a landing page (a link naming the page): while that page is
 *    PUBLISHED, or is the page a valid preview token names, AND the image is
 *    the page's own, or of its company and something the page references —
 *    an image in its blocks, theme, HTML or CSS (a duplicated page links
 *    into the original's folder), or the photo of the product it sells or
 *    offers as an add-on (placed by the server, not written in the page).
 *    The product's own status does not matter here: the page is public, and
 *    it is showing it.
 *  - on its own (a storefront's catalogue): an ACTIVE product whose store's
 *    storefront is open. Nothing else — a page's images are always asked
 *    for through the page.
 *
 * Anything else — a draft, an image no public page shows, a closed shop, a
 * store's folder of logos past and present — stays private, with no
 * difference between "no such file" and "not public". The answer is the
 * owner's company, from its own row: the URL never names one.
