/**
 * WHO DID THE WORK, AND HOW FAST.
 *
 * A manager asking "how is the confirmation desk doing" was given lifetime
 * totals with no date on them: an agent who worked hard last quarter and
 * nothing this week outranked one who carried the whole week. Every number
 * here is bounded by a window, and counted at the moment the action
 * happened — claimed THIS week, confirmed THIS week — so a row reads the
 * way a manager says it out loud.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices, because they are the ones that decide whether the
 * report is trusted:
 *
 *   BUSINESS MINUTES, never wall-clock. An order claimed at 16:55 and
 *   confirmed at 09:05 the next morning took ten minutes of work, not
 *   sixteen hours. The same calendar that freezes every SLA in the system
 *   freezes this, so nobody is punished for going home.
 *
 *   MEDIAN, never average. One order left open over a weekend moves an
 *   average by hours and says nothing about the other forty. The median is
 *   the typical call, which is what "كم ساعة بتاخد" actually asks.
 *
 * Rows are read from the append-only records — claim history and the
 * confirmation status log — not from the order's current columns. Those
 * columns hold the LAST thing that happened; a report of who did what needs
 * every thing that happened.
