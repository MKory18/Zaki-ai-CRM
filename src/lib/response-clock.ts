/**
 * THE RESPONSE CLOCK.
 *
 * An order sitting claimed and untouched is the most expensive thing on the
 * confirmation desk: the customer ordered minutes ago, is still warm, and
 * every hour that passes turns a sale into a "I changed my mind". Pulling an
 * order out of the pool and not calling is worse than leaving it in the
 * pool, because nobody else can take it.
 *
 * So the agent sees two clocks, and both are also averaged into her
 * performance:
 *
 *   PER ORDER — how long from pulling it to the first thing she did about
 *   it. This is the number the customer feels.
 *
 *   SINCE THE LAST PULL — how long since she took anything new. An agent
 *   with an empty desk and a full pool is idle; an agent holding twelve
 *   open orders is not.
 *
 * "The first thing she did" means a logged contact attempt or a recorded
 * confirmation decision, whichever came first. Opening the screen is not an
 * action: a clock that stops when somebody looks at a row measures nothing.
 */

/**
 * The first recorded action on each of these orders.
 *
 * Two sources because either can come first: an agent who calls and logs a
 * no-answer has an attempt and no decision; an agent who confirms straight
 * away has a decision and no attempt.
