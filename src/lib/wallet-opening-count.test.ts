/**
 * THE MONEY A WALLET STARTED WITH, AND WHO COUNTED IT.

 * `walletBalance` (opening + IN − OUT) and therefore in every daily closing,
 * and is ALREADY immutable after creation — the wallet PATCH schema accepts
 * `name` and `isActive` and nothing else. None of that is rebuilt here.
 *
 * What the cutover asks for and the system could not answer: the opening
 * balance comes from a physical count taken at the switch time, SIGNED BY THE
 * PERSON COUNTING. The audit log records who CREATED the wallet, which is the
 * person who typed the number — not the two people who counted a drawer.
