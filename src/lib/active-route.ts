 *
 * per item, which is true for MORE THAN ONE item whenever one route's
 * path is a prefix of another's. `/store/landing-pages` lights
 * «صفحات الهبوط» AND «المتجر», so the menu says the person is in two
 * places at once — and the one they are actually in is the less
 * prominent of the two.
 *
 * `ScreenTitle` had it right, and only because it needed a single answer
 * to print a heading: among the matching prefixes, take the LONGEST. That
 * is the rule, and it lives here now so there is one of it.
 *
 * Pure, with no imports: the sidebar and the drawer run in the browser,
 * and the frame is rendered on the server.
