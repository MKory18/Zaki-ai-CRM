/**
 * «الطباعة في خانة الطلبات غير موجودة اختفت».
 *
 * It had not been removed. It lived in the bulk bar — and the bulk bar
 * appears only once a row is ticked, so a screen opened fresh had no print
 * control anywhere on it. Measured first, because the other explanation
 * was a permission: `ops.labels` is held by the owner, the manager, the
 * shipping manager and the warehouse, so that was not it.
 *
 * The act it was missing is the common one: one parcel, one waybill, from
 * the row. Reaching that through a checkbox built for batches is a step
 * for nothing, and a screen whose only print button is conditional on a
 * selection is a screen where printing looks deleted.
