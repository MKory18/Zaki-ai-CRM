/**
 * THE ORDERS LIST'S «WHERE», WRITTEN ONCE.
 *
 * Three places asked the same question of the same table and answered it
 * three different ways:
 *
 *   GET /api/orders            the list on screen
 *   GET /api/reports/export    the CSV of «what I am looking at»
 *   GET /api/orders/:id        the ‹previous› and ‹next› arrows
 *
 * They had drifted, and each drift is something a person sees and cannot
 * explain:
 *
 *   · Scanning a courier barcode into the search box found the parcel in
 *     the list and found NOTHING in the CSV of that same search — the
 *     export's search looked at the order number, the name and the phone,
 *     and not at `trackingNumber` or `merchantRef`.
 *   · The arrows filtered on the LEGACY `status` column. The list stopped
 *     doing that deliberately — its own comment says «the legacy status
 *     column drifts from confirmation/shipping status, so filtering on it
 *     returned rows the screen was calling something else» — and the
 *     arrows were never brought along. With a state filter active they
 *     walked a different set, or none.
 *   · The arrows knew nothing of the governorate, the courier, the source,
 *     the dates or «late»: filter the list six ways, open an order, press
 *     ‹next›, and you leave the list you were reading.
 *
 * The export route has already been patched twice for exactly this — its
 * own comments record the CSV that ignored «متأخرة ١٠ أيام» and the one
 * that ignored the role's visibility envelope. A comment that says «keep
 * this in step with the other file» is the defect, not the fix.
 *
 * So: one function, three callers, and a test that asks all three the same
 * question and fails if the answers differ.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and why:
 *   · the tenant (`companyId`/`storeId`) — the caller already resolved it;
 *   · `createdAt` — the list takes the dates as given, while the export
 *     forces a ninety-day window and clamps a wider one. Two rules, both
 *     deliberate, so each caller passes its own resolved range;
 *   · `applyQueueFilter` — it needs the session and decides which queues a
 *     role may use at all. It wraps the result of this function.

/**
 * THE SAME GRAMMAR, WRITTEN RATHER THAN READ.
 *
 * Everything above turns a query string into a `where`. A screen needs the
 * other direction: the ten controls a person has set, as the one query
 * string that asks for them. Two things need it and they must not each
 * invent it —
 *
 *   · «العروض المحفوظة» stores a view AS a query string and nothing else,
 *     so a saved view is only as faithful as this function;
 *   · the CSV export forwards the filters it was asked for.
 *
 * ABSENT, `''` AND `'all'` ARE ONE THING — read `ordersWhere` above: every
 * branch is `if (value && value !== 'all')`. So the canonical form OMITS a
 * filter that is not set, and a saved view carries only what was chosen.
 * That is also why a short query string and a long one with six `=all` in
 * it return the same rows: this is a shorter spelling, not a second rule.
 *
 * AND APPLYING A VIEW CLEARS WHAT IS NOT IN IT. `orderFiltersFromQuery`
 * starts from `EMPTY_ORDER_FILTERS`, so recalling «المتأخرة — أرامكس» shows
 * exactly that and not that plus whatever was already on the screen. «Show
 * me this view» is the request; «add this to what I have» is not.
