/**
 * «المنتجات: AI + Score» — WHAT A PRODUCT'S GRADE CAN HONESTLY SAY.
 *
 * The owner wrote it twice. It is the last of the nine screens he asked for
 * a grade on, and «AI» in his note means the same thing it meant on the
 * other eight: let the screen tell me something instead of making me work
 * it out. NO MODEL IS CALLED HERE and nothing in this file could call one.
 * Every sentence below is a template around an integer somebody can count
 * by hand — and being countable by hand is the whole point, because a
 * sentence a model produced cannot be argued with.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * MEASURED FIRST, ON THE DEV DATABASE, 2026-09-29 — AND THE NUMBERS
 * CHANGED THE DESIGN THREE TIMES
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   114 products, every one ACTIVE. 12 have ever appeared on an order
 *     line. 102 have never been ordered at all.
 *   171 orders: 164 confirmed, 119 delivered, 32 returned.
 *   Ever-confirmed lines per product: 74, 31, 29, 8, 7, 6, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0.
 *     So THREE products clear a floor of ten, and the fourth-busiest has
 *     eight. A grade is possible on three rows out of a hundred and
 *     fourteen, and pretending otherwise would mean inventing a floor low
 *     enough to grade a product that sold twice.
 *   Their delivery rates are 73%, 84% and 76% — a real spread, which is
 *     why the heaviest band is worth having at all.
 *   87% of the orders were created on ONE day (2026-09-10) and 96% of the
 *     deliveries landed on ONE day (2026-09-15, 114 of 119). Anything
 *     time-shaped is unmeasurable on this record, and two candidate bands
 *     died of it — see the refusals below.
 *   `estimatedCostOfGoods` is recorded on 4 of 119 delivered orders, and on
 *     NONE of the three products that can be graded. So the margin band is
 *     declared, weighted, permissioned — and null on every graded row
 *     today, which is why the score reads «من 70» rather than «من 100».
 *   90 of 114 products carry no `basePrice` at all, 113 of 114 no image,
 *     114 of 114 no category. Including the five products that brought
 *     almost every delivered pound in the shop.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO AXES, DELIBERATELY NOT ADDED TOGETHER
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PERFORMANCE — a banded score out of what could be measured. It speaks
 * for 3 of 114 products, and for the other 111 it says which of four
 * different things is true of them.
 *
 * READINESS — whether the catalogue record is complete enough to sell the
 * thing at all. It speaks for all 114, needs no sample, and every gap it
 * names is a field on the products screen's own edit form.
 *
 * They are printed side by side and NEVER summed, for the reason
 * `employee-grade.ts` gives for keeping quality and presence apart: a
 * product with a perfect record and no price is not the same thing as one
 * with a price and a terrible record, and a single fused figure would hide
 * both. And the arithmetic reason is sharper here: a floor of ten confirmed
 * orders hides the score on 111 rows, so folding readiness into it would
 * hide the ONE thing this screen can say about 111 products behind a floor
 * that has nothing to do with it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `channel-score.ts`, AND WHAT IS BORROWED FROM IT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `channel-score` scores DOORS. Its five bands are keyed to a channel's
 * funnel — confirmation, collection, the value of one order through that
 * door — and its docblock already explains why it is not
 * `performance-score.ts`, which scores PEOPLE. A product is a third
 * subject: it is the only one of the three that can be UNSELLABLE while
 * performing perfectly, and the only one whose grade has to answer for a
 * record 102 rows of which have never traded.
 *
 * Every convention is borrowed on purpose, so the three read as one idea:
 *
 *   the weights are FIXED in code and are never editable fields;
 *   a band that could not be measured scores NULL, never zero, and drops
 *     out of the total the row is «out of» — so a score reads «41 من 70»
 *     and the missing thirty points name themselves;
 *   below the sample floor there is no number at all;
 *   a band that this record cannot carry is declared, refused, and SAYS SO
 *     — which is exactly what `collection_rate` does over there.
 *
 * And the floor is the same TEN that `health.ts` puts under every rate it
 * judges and `channel-score.MIN_CONFIRMED` puts under a door: a product
 * whose delivery rate `health.ts` refuses to grade must not be handed a
 * score built mostly out of that same rate.

 *   a product, and the measured spread across the three gradeable rows is
 *   eleven points of delivery rate.
 *
 *   MARGIN 30 — what one delivered unit LEFT us with. It keeps its weight

 *   starts recording the cost of goods the score gets STRICTER rather than

 * EVERY BAND THAT WAS TESTED AGAINST THIS RECORD AND REFUSED — AND THE
 * MEASUREMENT THAT KILLED IT.
 *
 * Kept in the code rather than in a commit message, because the next person
 * to be asked for «AI + Score» on this screen will reach for exactly these
 * four, and the reason each one is absent is a fact about the data that
 * they would otherwise have to rediscover.
 *
 *   RETURN RATE — returns out of what the product has FINISHED with. It is
 *   not an independent fact HERE: the three gradeable products have 2, 0
 *   and 0 confirmed orders still open, so returned = confirmed − delivered
 *   almost exactly, and the band would restate the delivery band backwards.
 *   Measured: delivery 73/84/76 against 100 − return of 75/84/76. A score
 *   whose bands all restate one number is that number with extra
 *   arithmetic, so one of the two had to go, and delivery is the one the
 *   owner asks for out loud. The counts are still RETURNED on the row, as
 *   facts beside the grade rather than as points inside it.
 *
 *   LAST SOLD / RECENCY — 96% of this shop's deliveries landed on one day,
 *   and the last delivery of each of the three gradeable products is 13.6,
 *   13.5 and 13.6 days ago. A band returning the same number for every row
 *   measures the day the data was imported, not the product. It is also
 *   already owned: `stock-health.recencyBand` reads that date for the
 *   inventory screen.
 *
 *   STOCK COVER — owned outright by `stock-health.ts`, which grades exactly
 *   this for the balances screen, with nine states, three bands and its own
 *   floors. A second, cruder answer to «هل يكفي المخزون» on a second screen
 *   is how `avgCostPerUnit` came to have two values on one page.
 *
 *   CONFIRMATION REFUSAL — the whole company has 7 refusals, of which 3
 *   name a product-side reason (2 × CUSTOMER_DOES_NOT_WANT_PRODUCT, 1 ×
 *   PRICE_TOO_HIGH); the three gradeable products carry 0, 0 and 1 between
 *   them. There is nothing to measure yet, and `deliveryFailureReason` is
 *   null on all 171 orders, so the door cannot be asked either.
 *
 *   BASKET DEPTH — units per delivered order, measured 1.93, 1.15 and 1.18.
 *   Genuinely independent of the delivery rate, and refused anyway because
 *   it is `delivered_value ÷ unit price`: with the value band present it
