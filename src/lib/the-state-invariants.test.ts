 * list that no order could enter, carrying a zone, a label, a tone and a
 * sentence addressed to a customer. Each one's work is done elsewhere, and
 * done better:
 *
 *   · `NEEDS_REVIEW` — doubt is held at the INTAKE door as a MESSAGE, before
 *     an order exists. So there was never a state to return to, which is why
 *     `return_to_state` was never built.
 *   · `IN_TRANSFER` — the move raises a REPLACEMENT order, so each parcel
 *     keeps the courier whose statement will settle it.
 *
 * These guards keep them out. Re-adding either by reflex — because the
 * contract's old wording named it — fails here with the reason.
