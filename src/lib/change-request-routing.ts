/**
 * WHO DECIDES A CHANGE REQUEST.
 *
 * It depends on how far the order has travelled, because the only person
 * who can answer "can this still be changed?" is the person currently
 * holding it.
 *
 *   NOT YET CONFIRMED, and somebody has it — the agent holding it decides.
 *   She is on the phone with the customer; a moderator wanting to change a
 *   quantity is asking HER whether it is too late, and routing that to a
 *   supervisor who has never spoken to this customer adds a wait and
 *   subtracts the only informed opinion.
 *
 *   CONFIRMED AND STILL IN THE WAREHOUSE — the warehouse decides too. The
 *   question at this stage is «can what goes in the box still change?»,
 *   and the only person who knows is the one standing at the packing
 *   table. Asked for in as many words: «مين بشوفه؟ المالك، السوبر أدمن،
 *   والمسؤول عن المخزن» — and «بس في حالة إنشاء شحنة وما انترحّل للشحن».
 *
 *   ONCE THE COURIER HAS TAKEN IT — the supervisor alone. The order is
 *   on a van and the question is now whether the courier can still be
 *   reached, which is neither the agent's authority nor the warehouse's.
 *
 *   THE LINE IS THE HANDOVER, NOT THE PRINTER. This first used
 *   `hasLeftWarehouse` — which starts at the printed waybill — and that
 *   is the wrong line for THIS question: a label coming off the printer
 *   commits the goods, but the box is still three feet away and can still
 *   be opened. «بحالة ما انضغط على زر سلّمت الشركة… ولما يوافق يقدر يعدل
 *   حقيقة عشان تظهر بالطباعة» — the approval is what the reprint shows.
 *   So the line is `handedToCourier`, and the two questions keep their
 *   two answers.
 *
 * A supervisor may decide either way. The agent might be off shift, the
 * request might be urgent, and an escalation path that stops working
 * because one person went home is not a path.
 *
 * Nobody decides their own request. That rule lives in the route and is
 * older than this file; it is named here only so the two are read together.
