/**
 * WHY AN ORDER WAS LOST — RECORDED, NOT INVENTED.
 *
 * The confirmation screen already refused to reject an order without a
 * structured reason, and demanded a sentence for «other». Three other doors
 * wrote one anyway:
 *
 *   `/call-logs` wrote `OTHER` for EVERY rejection logged from a call — the
 *   one value that says nothing, in the field the analysis of lost orders
 *   will read.
 *
 *   Voiding an entry issue wrote `FAKE_ORDER`. An entry issue is OUR mistake,
 *   and every report counting fake orders was counting our own typing.
 *
 *   And a wrong number was filed as a no-answer, so it burned three calls
 *   nobody could ever have answered and closed as «three attempts, no reply»
 *   — a statistic that says «we cannot reach people» when the truth is «our
 *   numbers are wrong».
