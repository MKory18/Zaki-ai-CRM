 * nothing about the ad that sent the visitor, how warm they are, how long
 * the page should be, what each piece of copy is FOR, or how many

     * A structure that lists its sections and its slots separately knows

     * turn one into a page. «المشكلة ← الحل» has three prose beats in a
     * row, and they are not interchangeable: which paragraph is «المحاولات
     * الفاشلة» is the structure, not a detail.
     *
     * `at` is the index in `sequence`; `field` is the name the section's
     * own schema gives that piece of text — `headline` on a hero, `body`
     * on a text block, `text` on an urgency bar. Both are checked below
     * against the sequence they point into.
     *
     * AND `field` MAY NAME A ROW AND A COLUMN: `points.0.when`.
     *
     * Five of the ten structures are built around a block whose content is a
     * LIST — the comparison's rows, the timeline's points, the quiz's
     * questions, the objections and their answers, the mechanism's steps. A
     * slot that could only address one named field could not reach any of
     * them, so those blocks were created empty, an empty block draws nothing,
     * and «رحلة التحوّل» came out as a page with no timeline in it: the one
     * thing that makes it that structure.
     *
     * The fix is not a new kind of slot. A slot is one piece of text with its
     * own purpose, its own «ممنوع» and its own example, and that is exactly
     * what a cell of those tables is — «الأسبوع الأول» wants a different
     * example from «الأسبوع الثامن». So the ADDRESS grew a row and a column
     * and everything else stayed: the same schema, the same editor, the same
     * library block, untouched.
     *
     * The row index is explicit rather than a count, so a structure says how
     * many rows it wants by writing that many slots — and the duplicate-seat
     * check below then does its ordinary job on them.
