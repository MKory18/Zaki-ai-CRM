/**
 * APPLYING AN APPROVED CHANGE REQUEST.
 *
 * The missing last step. Once a waybill is printed, or the parcel is in a
 * handed-over batch, the order is SEALED: the address the driver holds and
 * the amount he collects are fixed somewhere we do not control. The seal
 * says so itself — "what was a direct edit becomes a change request:
 * somebody who can still reach the courier decides". Somebody did decide.
 * And then the edit that carried the decision out hit the same seal, and
 * was refused. An approved request on a sealed order could not be applied
 * by anyone.
 *
 * So an approved request is now the one authority that passes the seal —
 * and only as far as it was approved:
 *
 *   The browser sends the request's id and nothing else. The VALUES come
 *   from the approved request, on the server. There is no way to apply a
 *   quantity other than the one that was approved, or to slip a second
 *   field in beside it under the request's authority.
 *
 *   Once. An applied request cannot be applied again.
 *
 *   After confirmation only. Before it the order is still on somebody's
 *   call list and is edited in the ordinary way.
 *
 *   By somebody who could have decided it — the same rule as approving.
 *
 * The edit itself still runs through the order's own route, so quantity,
 * discount and product go through the money path exactly as a direct edit
 * would, and nothing here computes an amount.
 */

/**
 * Change-request fields and the order-edit field each one becomes.
 *
 * ONE is missing on purpose now, and the refusal names it: the order edit
 * has no offer. A request for it could be raised and approved but never
 * carried out; saying so is better than applying half of it.
 *
 * The city used to be the other one — and that was the wrong answer to
 * the right observation. The order ships to a REGION, so the request now
 * carries `regionId`, which the order route does write. A door that
 * accepts a request it can never carry out is worse than one that refuses
 * it at the start.

/**
 * AN APPROVED REQUEST AS THE AUTHORITY FOR A CANCELLATION OR A HOLD.
 *
 * The edit path set this precedent and states its reasoning: an approved
 * request is «the one authority that passes the seal», because it carries a
 * raiser, a reason, a decider, an SLA that escalates and an audit row —
 * strictly more control than the direct edit it replaces, not less.
 *
 * The other two intents need it for the same reason and one more. Measured
 * on this company: `control.change_requests` is held by MANAGER,
 * COMPANY_ADMIN, DELIVERY_MANAGER and CONFIRMATION_SUPERVISOR, while
 * cancelling directly needs `orders.unlock` — MANAGER, COMPANY_ADMIN and
 * SUPER_ADMIN — and standing a shipment down needs `ops.ship`, which is
 * neither. So two of the four people the queue is addressed to could
 * approve a cancellation and then not carry it out, and the request would
 * sit in «بانتظار التطبيق» until somebody with a third permission noticed.
 *
 * An approval that cannot be acted on is not an approval. So the decision
 * is the authority, and the permission still governs the door with no
 * decision behind it.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is widen anything else: the carry-out keeps every one
 * of its own guards. `assertCancellable` still refuses once the goods have
 * left, and answers with the return that is the real remedy there.
