/**
 * A DECISION NOBODY HEARD IS NOT A DECISION.
 *
 * Almost all of this existed and was right: the request, the routing rule
 * that picks the decider by how far the order has travelled, the SLA that
 * escalates and never approves, the «بانتظار التطبيق» half, and an apply
 * step that runs the approved values through the order's own money path.
 *
 * Three things were missing, and they are the same thing seen three times —
 * the person who asked was outside the loop:
 *
 *   1. The DECISION notified nobody. Raising told the decider; an overdue
 *      request told the supervisors; approving or rejecting sent not one
 *      message, in a file with no notification import at all.
 *   2. Her own request was INVISIBLE to her. The queue's non-supervisor
 *      filter was «orders still in my hands», which is the set she has to
 *      ANSWER, not the set she ASKED.
 *   3. It could not be TAKEN BACK. `CANCELLED` was in the status list from
 *      the start with nothing writing it — while a blocking pending request
 *      refuses every forward shipping transition, and any pending one
 *      refuses a second request on that order. One wrong press froze the
 *      order, and the corrected request could not be raised either.
