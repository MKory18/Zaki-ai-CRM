/**
 * THE PROMISE A RESTYLE MAKES.
 *
 * Only the looks change. No button gained, no column lost, no field quietly
 * folded into its neighbour, no icon dropped because the new spacing made
 * the row feel crowded. That promise is normally kept by somebody scrolling
 * through the diff, which works up to about the fortieth file.
 *
 * So it is counted. If a restyle removes a column, this fails and names the
 * file, before a browser is opened and long before somebody in a warehouse
 * notices the quantity is gone.
 *
 * WHEN A CHANGE IS INTENDED — a real feature, adding a screen or a field —
 * the baseline is rewritten deliberately:
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/ui-inventory.ts --write
 *
 * and the new numbers go in the same commit as the feature. That is the
 * point: a change to this file is a change somebody had to mean.
