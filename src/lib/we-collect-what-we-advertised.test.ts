/**
 * «العرض ع ٣ بـ١٠ بنحصّل ع ١٠. إذا قطعة بنحسب ثمن قطعة عدد صحيح.»
 *
 * The owner's rule, and it settles a conflict I had reported as unresolvable:
 * a total that does not divide evenly cannot be `quantity × unitPrice` at any
 * number of decimals, so somebody must absorb the remainder. The answer is
 * that nobody does — because the unit price must not be rounded at all.
 *
 * The division carries its own precision and the PRODUCT is what gets
 * rounded. 10 ÷ 3 is 3.3333333333333335; multiplied by three it is
 * 10.000000000000002; rounded to the currency it is exactly 10. Round the
 * unit price first and you get 3.333 and a total of 9.999 — a fils lost to
 * arithmetic nobody asked for.
 *
 * I had this wrong twice in one day: the Telegram door rounded to two
 * decimals, I "fixed" it to round by the currency, and both are wrong in the
 * same way. The offers door never rounded, which is why it was always right.
