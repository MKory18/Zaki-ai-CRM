/**
 * CUSTOMER RISK — return rate over the last 6 months OR the last 10 orders,
 * whichever window holds more orders. The customer is company-wide: one
 * phone, one person, one risk history, never scoped per country.
 *
 * Tiers: under 15% safe, 15–40% watch, above 40% high risk. High risk also
 * when two returns land within 60 days.
 *
 * WHAT THE TWO FLAGS ARE, EXACTLY — because this comment used to claim «the
 * API says so, the UI only renders it», and the API does not say so:
 *
 *   · `requiresPrepaymentOrApproval` is ADVICE. It reaches the confirmation
 *     assistant as context and it reaches the screens. NO door refuses a
 *     cash-on-delivery confirmation for a high-risk customer. The contract
 *     asks for that refusal; building it means deciding what counts as
 *     approval and which role may give it, which is the owner's to say.
 *   · `excludedFromAutomatedConfirmation` has nothing to exclude from: no job
 *     confirms orders. The day one is written it must read this flag, and the
 *     guard in `the-customer-invariants.test.ts` says so where it will be
 *     seen.
 *
 * A comment claiming an enforcement that does not exist is worse than
 * silence: it is the reason nobody looks.

/**
 * THE «SAME PERSON» CLAUSE — by phone, across every store of the company.
 *
 * `Customer` is unique on `[companyId, storeId, phone]`: the stores are
 * separate businesses and each keeps its own record of the same person. So
 * one phone is SEVERAL customer rows with several ids, and asking by id makes
 * every answer per store. A customer who returned six of ten parcels at one
 * shop arrived SAFE at the shop next door, while this file said «one phone,
 * one person, one risk history».
 *
 * The system had already ruled the identical question for the blacklist, in
 * the schema's own words: «a blocked number that can order from the shop next
 * door blocks nothing.» `activeBlock` matches `{ companyId, phone }` with no
 * store. The risk is the same fact about the same person.
 *
 * IT LIVES HERE, AND ONLY HERE, because reading the number is a privacy cost
 * and one place should pay it. The confirmation assistant's route is guarded
 * against selecting a phone at all — rightly: it sends text to a model. So it
 * asks `customerHistory` instead of resolving the person itself.
 *
 * `@@index([companyId, phone])` carries the relation filter. The id is the
 * fallback for a row that cannot be read, so a missing customer narrows the
 * question instead of throwing.
