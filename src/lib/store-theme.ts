/**
 * WHAT A STORE LOOKS LIKE — one owner, one record.
 *
 * The colour engine already exists: one accent, a mood, and a palette
 * derived from them (landing-theme.ts). This does NOT replace it. A store's
 * theme IS a landing theme plus the things only a shop has — a header, a
 * footer, how a price is written, what the checkout asks for, whether a
 * cart bar rides at the bottom of the screen, and what order the home page
 * puts its sections in.
 *
 * WHO OWNS A COLOUR. The store does. A landing page used to carry its own
 * theme, and so did the store, which is two answers to "what colour is this
 * shop" — the same mistake as a currency on the organisation AND on the
 * country. A page's theme is now an OVERRIDE: absent by default, and when
 * present it is that one page departing from its store's template, which
 * the editor says out loud. `themeForPage` below is the only place the two
 * are combined.
 *
 * EVERY COLOUR IS A VARIABLE. The eight the seller can name are emitted as
 * CSS custom properties beside the derived ones; nothing is written as a
 * hex literal in a component. A colour left unset is not a blank — it is
 * the palette's own, derived from the accent, so a seller who sets one
 * colour gets a coherent shop rather than seven holes.
