/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ELEVEN ORNAMENTS, AND THE THREE THINGS THAT MAKE ONE SAFE.
 *
 * The owner, 20/10: «شكل الإطار لكل ثيم… وزيد عليه رمز صغير باهت بزاوية
 * الكرت… الرسمات بالأماكن التلاتة وبكرت الترحيب بس. ولا رسمة ورا رقم أو
 * مبلغ.»
 *
 * Until now a theme's decoration was two radial washes built from
 * `--sys-primary-soft`, identical in all eleven. Eight of them are MOODS —
 * neon, gold, parchment, a sky with no moon — and the same wash under all
 * of them made the choice a recoloured spreadsheet, which is the thing
 * `theme-decoration.ts` opens by saying it must not be.
 *
 * So each theme now wears a drawing of its own. The three things that
 * keep a drawing from becoming a problem are pinned here, because every
 * one of them is invisible until it is too late:
 *
 *   ① It is a MASK, so its colour is the theme's own `--sys-primary` and
 *     it cannot carry a twelfth palette nobody measured.
 *   ② Its loudness is MEASURED, not chosen, so a replacement drawing
 *     cannot arrive at the wrong volume unnoticed.
 *   ③ «تلقائي» gets BOTH, because it has two palettes and one ornament
 *     would be a radar sweep on a white screen at noon.
 *
 * The rule that it never appears behind money is the OTHER file's —
 * `a-theme-is-not-a-mood-swing.test.ts` sweeps every screen for it — and
 * this one does not restate it.
