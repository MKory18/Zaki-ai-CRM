/**
 * THE ENGINE'S PARTS CATALOGUE.
 *
 * Every variant of every component the storefront can draw, named once.
 * A template picks from this list, the shop's theme stores the pick, and
 * the components read it — three readers, one vocabulary.
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN MODULE. It began inside store-skin.ts, which is the
 * template CONTRACT. But the contract imports the block library (its
 * home sections are that library's own section types), so the block
 * library could not import the contract back to learn which hero
 * variants exist — and a second list of hero names is exactly how a
 * template comes to ask for one nobody built.
 *
 * So the catalogue sits under both: the contract picks from it, the
 * parts declare themselves in it, and neither depends on the other.
 *
 * ADDING A VARIANT IS TWO EDITS, DELIBERATELY: a name here and the CSS
 * or markup that draws it. A name with nothing behind it renders the
 * default and tells nobody, which is the failure this list exists to
 * make impossible.

 * said what must not happen without giving anybody a way to say «this one
 * is deliberately gone». So thirteen of twenty-seven names drifted into
 * exactly that state — see `docs/storefront/AUDIT-2a-delta.md`.
 *
 * A retired variant is one nobody will build. It is:
 *
 *   NOT DELETED. A store's theme may already hold it, and deleting the
 *   name would make that theme fail to parse — a seller's shop going
 *   blank because of a decision about a list.
 *
 *   NOT OFFERED. `liveVariants()` is what the editor shows, so a seller
 *   cannot newly choose one.
 *
 *   NOT SILENT. The theme screen reads `retiredNoteAr()` and says, on the
 *   seller's own screen, which variant their template is holding and what
 *   the shop draws instead. Falling back without a word is the failure;
 *   falling back and saying so is a decision.
