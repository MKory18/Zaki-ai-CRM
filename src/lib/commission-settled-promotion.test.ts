/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE MOMENT AND THE STATE — the commission nobody could ever be paid.
 *
 * `markPayableForOrders` is the only writer of PAYABLE in the codebase, and
 * it is a MOMENT: it runs inside the statement-approval transaction, over
 * the orders that statement matched. The condition it stands for — the money
 * for this order is in — is a STATE.
 *
 * On the normal path the entry is born AFTER that moment. The statement
 * delivers and settles the order in one transaction; the accrual job writes
 * the entry that night. The entry is then ACCRUED with its money sitting in
 * the wallet and the only writer of PAYABLE already finished, so the payout
 * door refused it for ever — and told the owner it «becomes payable when the
 * collection statement is approved», naming an approval already past. Two
 * orders on the golden-path walk ended exactly there.
 *
 * These tests are not where-clause spelling checks. They run the real
 * filters against rows in memory under Prisma's own semantics, so breaking
 * any one condition breaks a test about money and not a test about a string.
