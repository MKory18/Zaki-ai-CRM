 *
 * A MOMENT CANNOT CATCH WHAT ARRIVES AFTER IT. And on the normal path the

 *
 *   statement approval — ONE transaction, in this order:
 *     markPayableForOrders(matched orders)   ← no entry exists yet: 0 promoted
 *     the orders become DELIVERED and SETTLED
 *     (delivery is what the statement proves; the accrual is not here)
 *   the nightly accrual job, hours later, or somebody pressing the button:
 *     accrueForOrder creates the entry — status ACCRUED
 *
 * The entry is now ACCRUED for ever. Its order is SETTLED, the cash is in
 * the wallet, and the only writer of PAYABLE already ran. The payout door
 * then refuses it with NOT_PAYABLE and tells the owner it «becomes payable
 * when the collection statement is approved» — an approval already months
 * past. Two orders on the golden-path walk ended exactly there, and it is
 * not an edge case: it is every order the statement delivers, which is
 * every order nobody ticked by hand.
 *
 * Re-ordering the statement transaction would not fix it either. The accrual
 * does not happen in that transaction at all, and making it happen there
 * would put the most delicate transaction in the system in charge of
 * commission rules, tiers and currencies. The moment is in the wrong place
 * for a reason that cannot be moved.
 *
 * So the door asks the STATE instead of trusting that the moment caught it.
 * This is the where-clause it asks with — a filter and not a boolean, on
 * purpose: a read, a decision in JavaScript, and then a write would let two
 * payouts both see ACCRUED and both pay. One conditional UPDATE cannot.
