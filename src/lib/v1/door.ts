/**
 * THE ENVELOPE `/api/v1` ANSWERS IN — and it is not this product's own.
 *
 * Every other door here answers `{ error, errorAr }`, because a person
 * reads it and the sentence has to say what to do next. Nobody reads this
 * one. `OMS-DOOR-V1.md` fixes the shape another SYSTEM parses:
 *
 *     { "error": { "code", "message", "details" }, "request_id" }
 *
 * — a machine-readable `code` it branches on, a `message` for the log a
 * developer reads, and the request id so a failure in the replies system
 * and a line in this one's log can be put side by side.
 *
 * SO THE ARABIC IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and that is not the English-message
 * debt `arabic-refusals.test.ts` was written about: that rule is about
 * sentences a PERSON meets on a screen. Translating a `code` a program
 * switches on would be a translated dead end of the literal kind.
 *
 * ── AND NOTHING IN HERE EVER CARRIES A CUSTOMER ──
 *
 * `details` is for a field name and a constraint, never for the value that
 * broke it. The order door takes a name, a phone and an address; echoing
 * one back inside an error would put a customer's details into the calling
 * system's error log, where nobody decided to keep them.
