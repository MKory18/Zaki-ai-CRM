/**
 * A POSTPONED ORDER THAT COMES DUE HAS TO BE REACHABLE.
 *
 * It keeps its claim, and that is right while the date is far off — the agent
 * who spoke to the customer should be the one to ring back. It is wrong the
 * moment it comes due: the pool only takes UNCLAIMED orders, so if she is off
 * that day the order sits where nothing in the product can pick it up. The
 * postponed screen showed it and offered no action at all.
 *
 * Most of what was asked for already existed and was right: the two-day lead
 * window, the job that announces the due ones at eight in the morning, and a
 * `pullNext` that looks for due postponed orders FIRST. The missing piece was
 * one button and the endpoint under it.
