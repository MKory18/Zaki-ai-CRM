/**
 * ONE SHAPE FOR EVERY AD PLATFORM.
 *
 * Meta, TikTok and Snapchat each answer a different API with a different
 * envelope, a different idea of what an account id looks like, and a
 * different way of expiring a token. What a seller wants from all three is
 * identical: is this connected, what campaigns are in it, and what did each
 * one spend.
 *
 * So the difference lives in an adapter and nowhere else. The routes, the
 * sync and the screen speak this interface and never name a platform — a
 * fourth one is a new file and a row in a list, not an `if` in six places.
 *
 * CREDENTIALS ARE A BAG, not a string, because the platforms disagree about
 * how many secrets a connection needs. Meta takes one long-lived token.
 * TikTok takes a token and the advertiser it belongs to. Snapchat's access
 * tokens die after thirty minutes, so it takes a client id, a secret and a
 * refresh token, and mints a fresh one on every call. A `token: string`
 * column would have forced the third of those into a lie.
