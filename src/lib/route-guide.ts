/**
 * A SCREEN THAT EXPLAINS ITSELF, ONE TAP FROM THE SCREEN.
 *
 * The owner, 21/10: «حاسو معجوق وصعب … شرح داخل السايت». The product had no
 * help at all — no tour, no guide, nothing that said what a screen was for
 * or what to do on it — and a new employee learned it by asking the person
 * at the next desk. The only thing near it was the ⓘ on the storefront
 * panels, which is a different agent's.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS WRITTEN ──
 *
 * Derived, and so never out of date: the screen's name (the registry's), its
 * place on a numbered road and the stop after it (`next-stop.ts`), and who
 * opens it (the registry's permissions, in the words the roles screen uses).
 *
 * Written, because only a person who has watched the screen used can say it:
 * the steps, in the order they are done, in the names of the buttons that
 * are on the screen. They live in `route-guide-texts.ts`, which is loaded
 * when the sheet is OPENED and not before — fifty screens of Arabic prose is
 * not something every page should download in case somebody is curious.
 *
 * ── WHY AN INDEX, WHEN THE TEXTS COULD SIMPLY BE IMPORTED ──
 *
 * The ⓘ has to decide, on first paint, whether to exist. Asking the texts
 * would mean loading them, which is the thing being avoided. So this file
 * keeps the list of screens that HAVE a guide, and a test holds it equal to
 * the keys of the texts — the one duplication in the design, guarded rather
 * than hoped about.
 *
 * ── NOT THE STOREFRONT'S ──
 *
 * `/store` and the landing pages belong to the storefront's own agent. Their
 * headers are the shared `PageHeader`, so a guide for them would put a button
 * on screens this work was told not to touch; the lookup refuses them.
