/**
 * TURNING A CUSTOMER INTO SOMETHING META CAN MATCH BUT NOT READ.
 *
 * The browser pixel in this system is forbidden from carrying any personal
 * detail, and that is right: anything a page sends travels through the
 * customer's own browser, where it can be read. The Conversions API is the
 * opposite case — it runs on our server, and it WANTS the phone and the
 * name, because that is how Meta knows the person who bought is the person
 * who saw the advert.
 *
 * So the rule here is not "no personal data". It is: the raw value never
 * leaves this machine. What leaves is a SHA-256 fingerprint, which Meta
 * compares against the fingerprint of its own records. It cannot be turned
 * back into a phone number. This is stricter than Meta's own Advanced
 * Matching, which sends these fields from the customer's browser.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS THE DANGEROUS ONE.
 *
 * Normalisation must match Meta's byte for byte. "0791234567" and
 * "+962791234567" are the same person and must produce the same hash; if
 * they do not, the match simply fails. And it fails SILENTLY — Meta accepts
 * the event, reports no error, and the match rate quietly sits near zero
 * while the seller believes the integration is working. There is no way to
 * notice this from the outside, which is why every rule below is tested.
