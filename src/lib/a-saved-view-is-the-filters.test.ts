/**
 * «العروض المحفوظة» — THE SAME NINE FILTERS, NOT SET AGAIN EVERY MORNING.
 *
 * `SavedViews.tsx` was a finished component with its own tests and no
 * screen: `nothing-unused-ships.test.ts` listed it under «بُني ولم يُوصَل»
 * and said, correctly, that wiring it or dropping it was a product decision
 * and not that file's to make. It is wired now, to the orders list, which
 * is the screen whose nine controls cost the most to set.
 *
 * A VIEW IS A QUERY STRING AND A NAME. No rows, no counts, no customer and
 * no order id — nothing that could still be true after the data has moved
 * on. Recalling one re-asks the question; it never replays an answer. It
 * lives in `localStorage`, so it is this browser's habit and not an object
 * on the server with an owner, permissions and a lifecycle.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The store is only as faithful as the function that
 * writes the string, so the two directions of the grammar are pinned
 * against each other AND against `ordersWhere`, which is the thing that
 * actually turns a string into rows. A short spelling that returned
 * different rows from the long one would be a second rule wearing the same
 * name.
