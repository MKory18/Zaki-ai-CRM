 * THE SHELF IS THE STORE'S — AT EVERY DOOR.
 *
 * Found while verifying line 8, and it was one defect wearing five faces.
 * Availability and reservation were store-scoped: `onHand` filters by
 * `storeId`, `availableStock` passes it, `receiveStock` writes it. Three
 * other doors ignored it entirely:
 *
 *   · `drawDownStock` took no `storeId` at all, so a delivery drew FIFO
 *     across EVERY store's batches and could empty a shelf another store
 *     had already promised — the exact case the batch's own doc comment was
 *     written against.
 *   · the stocktake's SHORTFALL half drew company-wide while its SURPLUS
 *     half wrote to the store.
 *   · a RETURN created its batch with no `storeId`, so counted, inspected
 *     goods landed in the company-wide pile — invisible to the store-scoped
 *     availability the store's own screens read. Restored and unsellable.
 *   · and the return's cost was read off whichever store had the newest
 *     batch, moving one store's profit by another's money.
 *
 * All five now pass the order's own store, using the convention `onHand`
 * already set: null means company-wide, so an order with no store behaves
 * exactly as before.
 *
 * AND THEN A SIXTH AND SEVENTH FACE, on 2026-10-07: THE LEDGER LINES.
 *
 * What this section said on 2026-10-02 was true of the BATCHES and silent
 * about the `InventoryMovement` rows written beside them. Both halves of
 * `stock-consumption.ts` wrote a movement with no store:
 *
 *   · the SALE line on delivery, while the `drawDownStock` call three lines
 *     above it was handed `order.storeId` and emptied THAT store's batches;
 *   · the RETURN line, directly under a batch created with
 *     `storeId: order.storeId` and the comment «back onto the shelf it
 *     left».
 *
 * `/api/inventory/movements` and the ledger block in `/api/inventory` filter
 * the MOVEMENT itself with the strict `inStore(companyId, storeId)`, so both
 * rows were written and then returned by no store's query. Measured on this
 * database before the fix: 30 of 30 movement rows carried no `store_id` —
 * 26 SALE and 4 RETURN. The whole stock ledger existed and was unreadable.
 *
 * AND THIS FILE WAS HALF OF WHY. «a return comes back onto the shelf it
 * left» asked the SOURCE TEXT whether the BATCH carried the store, inside a
 * window that ended at `batchNumber` — so it could not have seen the
 * movement four lines further down even in principle. A half-fix read as
 * complete. It is replaced below by the PAIR, asserted by running the two
 * functions against a transaction that answers for real and reading the
 * rows they hand Prisma.
