/**
 * A SECOND ORDER FOR THE SAME SALE.
 *
 * Two moments need one: a parcel taken back from a courier company, and a
 * change to the goods on a parcel they are already holding. Both are the
 * same physical fact — that parcel is out there under their barcode and
 * will appear in their statement, so it cannot be edited into being a
 * different parcel. What ships instead is a NEW order, linked to the old
 * one by `replacesOrderId`, and the old one ends as a return.
 *
 * The transfer route built this first and built it correctly. The reorder
 * needed the same thing, and a second copy of it is where «the lines are
 * carried over» or «the goods come off the shelf now» silently stops being
 * true on one of the two paths. So it is written once, here, and the two
 * callers differ only in where the replacement is going and what the note
 * on it says.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is decide. It does not read a seal, check a
 * permission or choose a status; the caller has already done all of that
 * and passes the answers in. This takes an order and returns its
 * replacement, reserved.
