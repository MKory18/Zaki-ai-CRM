/**
 * WHICH KIND OF SPENDING IS QUIETLY TAKING A BIGGER BITE.
 *
 * The expenses ledger lists rows: date, title, type, amount, notes. Nothing
 * anywhere adds them up PER TYPE, so the one question an owner actually has
 * about spending — «على أيّ بند يذهب مالي، وأيّ بند يكبر من تحتي» — had no
 * answer on any screen. The type was not even readable: the ledger printed
 * the raw enum, «MARKETING» in Latin capitals, in a right-to-left Arabic
 * table whose own form offers «تسويق وإعلانات».
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY REFUSES TO BE, AND WHY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is NOT a «worth it» score, and it will not become one by weighting
 * things harder. «Worth it» is a ratio of what a kind of spending RETURNED
 * to what it cost, and this database holds no link from an expense to
 * anything it bought. `Expense.referenceId` is documented as «batchId or
 * orderId» and is the only candidate; there are no expense rows at all, so
 * it is set on none of them. Without that link the return of a marketing
 * dinar is unknowable, and a score built on an assumed return would be a
 * ranking of assumptions — the precise thing that killed this product's
 * intelligence layer, where every customer graded the same.
 *
 * It is also NOT a 0..100 score, for a plainer reason: a hundred-point
 * scale needs a ceiling, and there is no such thing as a perfect share of
 * revenue to spend on packaging. Inventing one bar per category would be
 * nine invented verdicts wearing arithmetic.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IT IS INSTEAD: TWO NUMBERS AND A DIRECTION, ALL THREE DERIVED
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   SHARE OF SPEND — of everything the shop spent this window, how much of
 *   it went here. Needs no bar: it is a composition, and it sums to 100.
 *
 *   BURDEN — this type's spend as a share of DELIVERED revenue. Stated as a
 *   figure and given no verdict of its own, because nobody can say what
 *   percentage of revenue office costs ought to be. Revenue is the right
 *   denominator and the only sound one available: it is money that actually
 *   reached a door, and unlike this shop's profit margin it does not rest on
 *   a cost field that is 3% filled.
 *
 *   DIRECTION — the one thing that CAN be graded without inventing a
 *   constant, because the bar is the shop's own past: this type's burden
 *   this window against the SAME type's burden over the window before,
 *   equally long. «تغليف كان 4% من الإيراد وصار 9%» is a fact, fully
 *   explainable, and it is exactly what «يبلع من تحتي» means.
 *
 * Direction is graded and burden is not. That asymmetry is the honest part:
 * a comparison against yourself needs no threshold, and a comparison against
 * an ideal needs one nobody has.
 */

/**
 * THE TYPES, IN ONE PLACE AT LAST.
 *
 * The list existed three times and agreed nowhere: as a prose comment on the
 * Prisma column, as eight `<option>` elements hardcoded in the expense form,
 * and as whatever string a caller happened to post. The form offered eight
 * and the column's comment listed eight DIFFERENT ones — the comment has
 * `COMMISSION` and the form has it too, but the comment's order and the
 * form's disagree, and neither is reachable from code that has to render a
 * stored value. Which is why the ledger fell back to printing the enum.
