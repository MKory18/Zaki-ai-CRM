/**
 * WHO SHOULD HEAR ABOUT THIS.
 *
 * Every notification used to be written once with no recipient and shown
 * to the whole company, so a moderator's bell carried every confirmation
 * of every colleague, in every store. An audience here is a question the
 * permission engine already knows how to answer — "who holds
 * confirmation.supervise?" — asked for one store, plus any named people
 * the event is personally about (the moderator whose commission depends
 * on a confirmation, the agent holding a postponed order).
 *
 * Nothing here is a second copy of a rule:
 *   - grants come from computeEffectiveGrants and are checked with can(),
 *     so role templates, per-user ALLOW / DENY and the ACTIVE requirement
 *     all apply exactly as they do on a request;
 *   - store reach comes from geo-context's reachesStore, the same rule
 *     the store picker uses.
 *
 * It needs no session. The scheduled jobs run in the worker process, where
 * there is no request and no cookie; the users are read from the database
 * and given their grants here.
 *
 * Cost is bounded, not per user: one query for the users, one for all of
 * their overrides, one per distinct role, and three for store reach.
 *
 * Platform SUPER_ADMINs have no companyId and are not in any company's
 * audience. They reach a company only through requireCompanyTenant's
 * fallback, and they are not the staff these messages are addressed to.
