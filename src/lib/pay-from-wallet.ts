/**
 * MONEY LEAVING A WALLET TO PAY A PERSON.
 *
 * Commission and salary are different debts and settle on different clocks,
 * but the act of handing the money over is one act, and it was about to be
 * written twice. Written twice it drifts: one of them rounds by the wallet's
 * minor unit and the other by a global rule, one records a movement and the
 * other forgets, and a year later two screens disagree about how much left
 * the drawer.
 *
 * Two currencies meet here and they are not the same question:
 *
 *   the person's — what they are owed, and what they are told they are
 *                  owed. An Egyptian employee counts in pounds.
 *   the wallet's — what actually left the business. There may be no pound
 *                  wallet at all; the money leaves the dollar one.
 *
 * The rate is written by the owner AT PAYMENT, because which wallet will
 * pay is not known before then — and it is stored and never recalculated.
 * A month already paid reads the same next year, whatever the market did.
