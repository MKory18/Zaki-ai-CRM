/**
 * Moving a parcel to a different courier.
 *
 * The courier is chosen once, when the shipment is created. After that it is
 * not a field you edit, because the parcel is physically somewhere: with a
 * company it sits in their pipeline under their barcode, and a statement
 * will eventually claim it. Overwriting the provider would silently detach
 * an order from the shipment that still holds it.
 *
 * So there are exactly two moves:
 *
 *   DIRECT   — only away from a مندوب (AGENT). He is immediate and local:
 *              the moment you hand the parcel on you have it back from him,
 *              so his leg is closed as received and the order re-dispatches
 *              with no replacement and no new number.
 *
 *   REPLACE  — away from a COMPANY, to anyone. The company's leg is closed
 *              as taken back, and a REPLACEMENT order is raised that starts
 *              in preparation and is assigned from scratch. The original
 *              keeps its history, its barcode and its place in whatever
 *              statement the company sends.
