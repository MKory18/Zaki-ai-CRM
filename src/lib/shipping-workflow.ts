/**
 * ONE WORD PER SHIPPING STATUS, AND IT LIVES HERE.
 *
 * `order-state.ts` learned this lesson once already, for the core state:
 * «There were three copies… six of the sixteen states were spelled
 * differently between the first two». The shipping status never learned
 * it. It had SIX vocabularies — the shipping card, the tracking screen,
 * the courier-custody screen, `ui/Badge`, the status route and `i18n` —
 * and every single value had at least two spellings:
 *
 *   DELIVERED          مسلَّم · تم التسليم · سُلّم · مُسلَّم
 *   SHIPPED            مشحون · تم الشحن
 *   OUT_FOR_DELIVERY   خرج للتوصيل · خارج للتوصيل
 *   FAILED_DELIVERY    فشل التوصيل · تعذر التوصيل · تعذّر التوصيل
 *   RETURN_REQUESTED   طلب إرجاع · طُلب إرجاعه · مطلوب إرجاعه
 *   READY_FOR_PICKUP   جاهز للاستلام · بانتظار الاستلام
 *   PACKING            تغليف · قيد التجهيز
 *
 * Nobody chose that; each screen chose once. The parcel a warehouse calls
 * «سُلّم» is the one the tracking screen calls «تم التسليم», and a person
 * comparing two screens cannot tell whether they are looking at the same
 * fact.
 *
 * HOW EACH WORD WAS PICKED. Where a core state carries the same name, its
 * word wins — the two axes describe one parcel, and a badge reading
 * «مسلَّم» above a card reading «تم التسليم» is the defect whichever of
 * them is «right». Otherwise the spelling already used in the most places
 * wins. The one exception is PACKING: the status route called it «قيد
 * التجهيز», which is the core state PREPARING's word, so the two would
 * have collided — it is «قيد التغليف», which is what it is.
