 * rate from the same `moderatorPerformance()` the attribution tables use. A
 * score that disagreed with the screen beside it would be worse than no
 * score: two numbers for one week, and an argument nobody can settle.
 *
 * Two readings did not exist anywhere and are written here: how often a
 * person's entries come back as an entry problem, and how heavily they
 * discount compared with the shop's own habit.
 *
 * This is deliberately a per-person loop over `measure()` rather than one
 * clever query. A report screen loaded a few times a day can afford the
 * round trips; a second set of definitions drifting from the first cannot
