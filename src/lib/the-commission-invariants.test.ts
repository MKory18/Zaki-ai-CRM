/**
 * تشطيب ١ — STAGE 1: THE COMMITMENTS LEDGER, the commission section.
 *
 * Eight lines in the contract, and this is the best-covered area in the
 * system: seven test files already hold most of them. So this ledger does
 * NOT restate them. It records WHERE each commitment's evidence lives, and
 * tests only the three things nothing was testing — the sample floor, the
 * retired duplicate column, and how the four «exclusions» are actually
 * served.
 *
 * WHERE THE EXISTING EVIDENCE IS:
 *   1 accrue on DELIVERED, payable only after settlement → commission.test
 *     («accrues on delivery, in the delivery month») and commission-payout
 *     («an entry that a settlement has not made payable yet» is refused).
 *   2 rules as data with effective_from → commission.test («picks the rule
 *     in force on that day, not today»).
 *   4 cross-sell by added_by / added_stage → commission-metrics.
 *   6 one reference currency, rate stored → commission-payout («stores the
 *     rate as written — a paid month must read the same next year»).
 *   8 ONE commission source → commission-one-source, in full.
