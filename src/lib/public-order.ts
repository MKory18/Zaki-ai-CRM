 * an offer of 25 with a discount of 3 was 22 by phone and 25 from the
 * landing page — the waybill carried 25 and the courier collected 25. The

 *
 * ONCE PER OFFER, NOT ONCE PER PICK. The manual door applies the offer's
 * discount flat — one order, one offer, one reduction, whatever the
 * quantity — and that is the behaviour being matched. Counting it per pick
 * would be a new pricing rule and the owner's to make, not this
 * function's. Deduplicating by offer id is what makes «the same bundle
 * twice as two cart lines» and «the same bundle at count 2» agree; without
 * it a browser could split one bundle across two lines and claim the
 * reduction twice.
 *
 * SUMMED ACROSS DISTINCT OFFERS, though. A basket may hold two different
 * bundles, each advertising its own reduction, and the manual door has no
 * opinion because it only ever knows one offer. Honouring only one of them
 * would break a promise printed on the other — the same reasoning
 * `deliveryIncluded` already settles below.
 *
