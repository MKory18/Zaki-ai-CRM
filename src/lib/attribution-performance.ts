/**
 * WHO BROUGHT THE BUSINESS, AND WHAT BECAME OF IT.
 *
 * Two questions with one shape. A moderator brings orders in; a channel is
 * the door they came through. Both are judged the same way, so they share
 * one query and one table rather than growing two reports that slowly stop
 * agreeing about what "delivered" means.
 *
 * The number that matters is the LAST one, not the first. Anyone can bring
 * a hundred orders; what the business keeps is what was delivered and
 * collected. So a row reads left to right as the funnel actually runs —
 * brought, confirmed, delivered, collected — and the rates are computed
 * from the step before, never from the top:
 *
 *   confirmation rate = confirmed ÷ decided   (still being worked is neither)
 *   delivery rate     = delivered ÷ confirmed (an order never confirmed
 *                       was never the courier's to deliver)
 *
 * Revenue is the SAME definition the profit screen uses: what was actually
 * collected where we know it, and the order total where we do not. A second
 * formula here is how two screens end up disagreeing about one week.
