/**
 * WHERE ORDERS DIE, WHY, AND WHICH OF IT COST MONEY.
 *
 * The dashboard counted rejections and never once asked why: `rejected: 41`
 * beside «الأكثر رفضاً» naming a product. Three structured fields hold the
 * answer — `rejectionReason` before confirmation, `deliveryFailureReason`
 * and `returnReason` after shipping — and not one report read any of them.
 *
 * THE TWO HALVES ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF LOSS, and that is the whole
 * reason they are reported apart rather than as one «إلغاءات» number:
 *
 *   BEFORE CONFIRMATION nothing was spent. The order never shipped, no fee
 *   was paid, no stock left the shelf. What it cost is calls — and calling
 *   it money lost would be a lie, because an order that was never going to
 *   convert is not a loss, it is a lead. So this half is reported as counts
 *   and shares, with NO money column. A number nobody can defend is worse
 *   than a missing one.
 *
 *   AFTER SHIPPING money actually left: the courier's delivery fee, paid
 *   whatever happens, plus his return fee to bring the parcel back, plus
 *   the goods themselves when they come back damaged. Those are invoices.
 *
 * AND THE FINDING THE COUNTS CANNOT GIVE. The expensive half and the cheap
 * half share their failures. «عنوان خاطئ» after shipping and «رقم خاطئ»
 * before it are one defect — our own data — caught once for the price of a
 * phone call and once for the price of two courier fees. So the report ends
 * on one number: what the after-shipping half spent on failures that a
 * better call before shipping would have caught. That is the only line on
 * it anybody can act on this week.
