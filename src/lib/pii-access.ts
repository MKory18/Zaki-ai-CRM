/**
 * WHO READ HOW MANY CUSTOMERS, AND WHEN IT STOPS LOOKING LIKE WORK.
 *
 * The customer table is the one asset here that is worth money to somebody
 * else: names, phones and addresses of everyone who ever bought. It is
 * already guarded on the way out — a permission, a store scope, a hundred
 * rows a page, an export that is capped, dated, rate-limited and logged.
 * What was missing is the quiet path: an agent who may legitimately see
 * customers, paging through all of them a hundred at a time, leaves no
 * trace at all.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT A ROW PER READ ──
 *
 * The obvious answer is to write an audit row every time somebody opens
 * the list. That buries the trail it was meant to create: a search box
 * fires on every keystroke, and a day of ordinary calling would put tens
 * of thousands of «looked at customers» rows over the handful of entries
 * that say who changed what. A log nobody can read is not a log.
 *
 * So the count is kept in memory and only the CROSSING is written: one
 * audit row and one alert the moment a person passes the threshold in a
 * window, and nothing more until that window rolls over. Ordinary work
 * writes nothing. Harvesting writes exactly one legible line.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS NOT ──
 *
 * It is not a rate limit: nobody is blocked. Someone may have a real
 * reason to read six hundred customers, and stopping them mid-task to
 * protect a table they are allowed to read would be the system getting in
 * the way of its own business. It raises a hand; a person decides.
 *
 * The counter lives in this process, like `rate-limit.ts` next to it, and
 * has the same limit: across several instances each keeps its own tally,
 * so the threshold is effectively per instance. That makes it a smoke
 * alarm, not a vault door — which is what the brief asks for.

 * loads inside a quarter of an hour. A day of calling does not reach it:
 * an agent works a queue of orders and opens the customers they are
 * calling. Reading five hundred people's contact details in fifteen
 * minutes is not calling anybody.
