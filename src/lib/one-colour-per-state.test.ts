/**
 * «THE SAME STATE SHOWS THE SAME WORD AND THE SAME COLOUR ON EVERY SCREEN.»
 *
 * The word half has owners and a guard. The colour half had an owner —
 * `STATE_TONE`, with its reasons written beside it — and no guard, so a
 * screen could disagree with it and nothing said so.
 *
 * Measured on the dashboard's seven status tiles: three of them did.
 * NEW, CONTACTING and SHIPPED were painted `--sys-primary` while the owner
 * calls all three `neutral`, and `order-state.ts` rules that out by name:
 *
 *   «There is no informational blue — the action colour is already in the
 *    blue family, and a chip painted the same family as a button is a chip
 *    people try to press.»
 *
 * So «مشحون» read in the accent on the dashboard and in plain foreground on
 * the orders list: two different claims about the same parcel, three clicks
 * apart.

   * own states, a profit LINE's states, a Telegram MESSAGE's states, and
