/**
 * تشطيب ٢ — PASS 3: «run a scheduled job twice → no duplicate side effect».
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE HOLDS: a constraint the DATABASE enforces must be
 * findable in the schema, by name.
 *
 * Six of this system's cascade guarantees are PARTIAL unique indexes — «one
 * period commission per person, per rule, per span», «one live penalty per
 * person, per kind, per day», «a hostname belongs to whoever proved it». A
 * partial unique index is the right tool and Prisma cannot express one, so
 * each lives in raw SQL inside a migration.
 *
 * WHICH MEANS NONE OF THEM APPEARS IN `schema.prisma`, and the model is what
 * a person reads. Auditing the commission job, I read `CommissionEntry`, saw
 * `@@unique([orderId, userId, status])`, noted that a period entry has
 * `orderId` NULL and that Postgres counts every NULL as distinct, and
 * concluded the hourly accrual could pay a person twice. I wrote the
 * migration. The index already existed, under a name the schema never
 * mentions, and was stricter than mine.
 *
 * A second constraint doing one job is the defect this audit hunts, and I
 * came one command from shipping it. So the names are in the schema now, and
 * this keeps them there.
