/**
 * A COURIER AND ITS FEES ARE ONE DECISION, AND NOW ONE SCREEN.
 *
 * `DeliveryFee` already carries `deliveryProviderId`: in the data a fee IS
 * «this courier, this region». Only the SCREENS were split, and each opened
 * with a link to the other because neither is usable alone.
 *
 * What kept them apart was the fear of one long page: fourteen regions per
 * courier, four couriers, fifty-six rows to reach one number. The answer was
 * not a page but a PANEL — the list stays a list, and a courier opens beside
 * it with its own fourteen rows. So these guards hold three things:
 *
 *   • one menu entry and one route, not two;
 *   • the fee editor knows one courier and asks for no other — a select at
 *     the top of it would be the old screen wearing a panel;
 *   • the coverage chip still says whether this courier can ship at all,
 *     because that fact is why anybody opens the panel.
