/**
 * Compute financial snapshot with Decimal-safe arithmetic (prisma Decimal).
 * All inputs/outputs are Decimal — floats never touch money math.
 *
 * ── IT MULTIPLIED BY QUANTITY TWICE OVER, AND BOTH VALUES WERE ALREADY
 *    WHOLE-ORDER TOTALS ──
 *
 * This read `sellingPrice * quantity` and `productCost * quantity`.
 * MEASURED on the live rows — a three-unit order:
 *
 *     ORD-2026-0030   quantity 3
 *       sellingPrice            36      SUM(quantity × unitPrice) = 36
 *       estimatedCostOfGoods    15
 *
 * So `Order.sellingPrice` IS the subtotal, proved against the lines rather
 * than assumed — `winback-lines.test.ts` says so in writing and the data
 * agrees on every multi-unit row. And every writer of
 * `estimatedCostOfGoods` multiplies by quantity itself
 * (`unitCost * qty` in three doors, `average * l.quantity` in the fourth),
 * so that is the order's total too.
 *
 * What this function therefore produced for that order:
 *
 *     subtotal     36 × 3 = 108     should be 36
 *     productCost  15 × 3 =  45     should be 15
 *     grossProfit  108 − 45 = 63    should be 21
 *
 * Three times the revenue, three times the cost, three times the profit —
 * and it is the ONLY writer of `subtotal`, `totalRevenue`, `grossProfit`
 * and `netProfit`, which the profit screens read. MEASURED: all four
 * columns are null on all 56 orders, because the one route that calls this
 * has no screen. So nothing stored is wrong today, and this is the good
 * moment to fix it — before the first use rather than after.
 *
 * ── THE PARAMETERS ARE NAMED FOR THEIR SCALE NOW ──
 *
 * `subtotal` and `goodsCost`, not `sellingPrice` and `productCost`. The
 * old names invited the multiplication: «price» and «cost» read as
 * per-unit, and a reader has to go and check four writers to find out they
 * are not. A name that carries the scale makes the mistake unwriteable.
 */

/**
 * WHAT THE GOODS ON ONE ORDER COST US — ONE ANSWER, FOR THE WHOLE ORDER.
 *
 * Two columns hold it and they are not the same thing, which is how the
 * figure came to be multiplied twice:
 *
 *   · `estimatedCostOfGoods` — written at creation by every order door, and
 *     every one of them multiplies by quantity. The ORDER's total.
 *   · `productCost` — one of the per-order finance columns, written only by
 *     `PATCH /api/orders/:id/finance`. Null on all 56 live rows, so its
 *     scale was never settled by data — only by this function, which used
 *     to multiply it. It is the TOTAL now, like its neighbour, because the
 *     finance route already fell back from one to the other in a single
 *     `??` chain and a chain whose two links have different scales is a
 *     figure that changes meaning depending on which link answered.
 *
 * Settled rather than documented: zero rows to migrate, and a comment
 * explaining that two interchangeable columns mean different things is a
 * comment that will be read after the mistake.
