/**
 * ONE COLUMN, ONE RULE — AND THE DOORS MAY NOT BRING THEIR OWN.
 *
 * `User.commissionRate` had two doors. `/api/users` validated it and wrote
 * the column's own default; `/api/moderators` validated nothing and wrote
 * `parseFloat(commissionRate) || 5.0`, a number declared in no schema, no
 * migration and no other door. `Product.basePrice` had two doors as well,
 * both writing `parseFloat(basePrice) || 0`, so a typo priced a product at
 * nothing and answered 200.
 *
 * The rules are values now, in one file each. This test checks the reading
 * BEHAVIOUR and then checks that no door has quietly grown a second rule
 * next to the shared one — a fallback re-added at a write site is how the
 * first divergence happened, and it reads as policy while bypassing it.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE NO LONGER GUARDS WITH A LIST OF HOSTILE STRINGS
 *
 * It used to. The price rule was guarded by twelve named strings — `'abc'`,
 * `'3,5'`, `'12abc'`, `''`, `'   '`, `null`, `undefined`, `true`, `{}`,
 * `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-0.01` — and the rate rule by eleven. Both lists were
 * written by someone who had just measured `parseFloat`, so both named the
 * notations `parseFloat` mis-reads and neither named `'0x10'`.
 * `readBasePrice('0x10')` returned **16** for as long as those lists stood,
 * and nothing failed, because a list guards the notations its author
 * happened to think of. That is not a gap in the list. It is what a list is.
 *
 * So the notations are GENERATED here, three ways, and each one states its
 * own limits so that what it does not cover is visible rather than assumed:
 *
 *   1. EXHAUSTIVELY — every string of length 1…4 over a declared alphabet of
 *      the characters that mean something to `Number()`. 4 is the length of
 *      `'0x10'`, which is the point. This is the sweep that finds a notation
 *      nobody named: a prefix, a separator or a sign arrangement that
 *      `Number()` reads and the rule should not, can only hide here by being
 *      longer than four characters or by using a character outside the
 *      alphabet. Both limits are one line of code away from the reader.
 *   2. BY CROSS PRODUCT — sign × base prefix × digit alphabet × shape ×
 *      whitespace wrapper, for the notations too long for the sweep:
 *      `'Infinity'`, `'١٢٣'` (this product is Arabic-facing), `'2,500'`,
 *      `'1e400'`, a no-break space, a byte-order mark. Adding a notation
 *      means adding it to ONE family and getting it crossed with every
 *      other, rather than writing out N strings and forgetting the N+1st.
 *   3. BY VALUE KIND — the non-strings a JSON body can carry, each named for
 *      what `Number()` does with it rather than for what it is.
 *
 * And the law applied to all three is not «these strings are refused». It is
 * the DIFFERENCE between `Number()` and the rule, stated once:
 *
 *      a string is a price if and only if it is written the way a decimal
 *      number is written — and `Number()` agreeing is not enough.
 *
 * «written the way a decimal number is written» is decided by `isDecimal`
 * below, scanned character by character with no regular expression, so it
 * cannot be the same mistake twice as the regular expression in
 * `numeric-input.ts` that the rule actually uses. The two are independent
 * statements of one grammar; the sweep is where they are made to agree.
 */

/**
 * Written the way a decimal number is written: an optional sign, digits with
 * an optional decimal point, an optional decimal exponent, and nothing else.
 *
 * Hand-scanned on purpose. `numeric-input.ts` decides this with a regular

 * the character class would be made twice and the sweep would agree with
 * itself. `s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9'` is ASCII by construction, which is
 * why `'١٢٣'` fails it — U+0660 is past U+0039.

 * `basePrice` have one rule» but «CAN a column have two».
 *
 * It could, and nine more sites did. `PATCH /api/orders/[id]` read
 * `quantity`, `unitPrice`, `sellingPrice`, `discountAmount` and
 * `shippingCost` with `z.coerce.number()` while `POST /api/orders` read the
 * same columns with `count()`/`money()`. `Campaign.spend`, the public cart's
 * `quantity`, and the AI-intake confirm payload's `quantity` and
 * `finalPrice` were the same. Nothing in the suite objected — because
 * nothing in the suite was asking the general question.
 *
 * `z.coerce.number()` IS `Number(value)` (zod 4 calls it), and `Number()` is
 * this, measured:
 *
 *     '0x10' → 16      '0b11' → 3      '0o17' → 15      '1e400' → Infinity
 *     ''     → 0       '   '  → 0      null   → 0       []      → 0
 *     ['5']  → 5       true   → 1      {valueOf:()=>7} → 7   new Date(0) → 0
 *
 * So the law below is not «these doors read strictly». It is:
 *
 *      NO FIELD THAT IS MONEY OR A COUNT MAY BE READ WITH
 *      `z.coerce.number()`, ANYWHERE IN THE TREE.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT NOT A LIST — four things, each of which is what would have
 * failed if it were missing:
 *
 *   1. THE COLUMN NAMES ARE DERIVED FROM `prisma/schema.prisma`. Every
 *      `Decimal` and `Float` field is money; every `Int` field whose name
 *      contains «quantity» is a count. A money column added tomorrow joins
 *      the law the moment it is in the schema, with nobody remembering to
 *      add it — which is the half a named list cannot have.
 *   2. AND THE SCHEMA IS NOT ENOUGH, which was MEASURED rather than
 *      assumed: the first draft of this law derived its vocabulary from the
 *      schema alone and DID NOT CATCH `finalPrice` — the AI-intake confirm
 *      payload's price, which is written to `Order.sellingPrice` under a
 *      different name. A request field does not have to be spelled like the
 *      column it lands in. So a second rule reads the NAME'S MORPHOLOGY:
 *      anything ending in price / cost / amount / fee / total / spend /
 *      discount / revenue / profit / balance / salary / quantity / qty is
 *      money or a count whatever the schema calls it. Both rules are
 *      general; neither is a list of fields.
 *   3. THE SWEEP IS THE WHOLE TREE AND HAS NO EXEMPTION LIST for law one.
 *      Not «these five doors»: every non-test `.ts` and `.tsx` under `src/`.
 *      A tenth door written next year is in it the day it is written.
 *   4. THE DETECTORS ARE PURE FUNCTIONS RUN AGAINST THE EXACT TEXT THAT WAS
 *      DELETED. A guard whose detector has quietly stopped matching
 *      anything passes forever and says nothing — ten vacuous guards have
 *      been caught in this audit. So each detector is first shown to FIND
 *      the real sites in a fixture, and only then shown to find none in the
 *      tree.
 *
 * AND THE BROADENING IN (2) IMMEDIATELY EARNED ITSELF: it found
 * `src/lib/order-import.ts`, a tenth site nobody had named, where the
 * spreadsheet importer reads `Number(rawQty)` and
 * `Number(String(rawPrice).replace(/[^\d.-]/g, ''))`. That file is not this
 * change's to write, so it is recorded below as open, with the figures it
 * really produces, rather than classified as acceptable.

 *
 * and no detector in this file could see it, because the argument is an

 * `Number` is loose. It is that **a strip does not refuse — it REWRITES**.
 * `/[^\d.-]/` deletes what it does not recognise and reads what is left, and

 * All three legs generate rather than list. The readers are the same three
 * the law already names; the rewriters are the three methods in JavaScript
 * that return a different string; and «names money or a count» is the schema
 * plus the morphology above, so a column added to `schema.prisma` tomorrow
 * is in this law the moment it is added.
 *
