/**
 * THE THREE THINGS A CUSTOMER SAYS AFTER THE ORDER IS CONFIRMED.
 *
 * «غيّر العنوان». «ألغِ الطلب». «مش هذا الأسبوع».
 *
 * The agent has an answer to the first and none to the other two. Her own
 * «ألغِ» and «تأجيل» buttons live on the queue screen and they are gone the
 * moment she confirms — after that, cancelling needs `orders.unlock` (the
 * manager) and holding a shipment back is an operations screen she cannot
 * open. So the customer says "cancel it", she says "I'll tell someone", and
 * whether anyone is told depends on whether she remembers.
 *
 * All three are one act: SHE CANNOT DO IT, SOMEBODY WHO CAN DECIDES, AND IT
 * IS CARRIED OUT. That is precisely what the change-request door already is
 * — a decider, an SLA that escalates and never auto-approves, an audit row,
 * and a notification to whoever must answer. It was only ever wired to one
 * of the three.
 *
 * So the request gains a word for what it is asking, and an approved one is
 * carried out through the path that ALREADY exists for that thing:
 *
 *   EDIT     → the apply path (money, seal and audit as a direct edit)
 *   CANCEL   → the confirmation route's `cancel`, which already refuses
 *              after the goods left and says why
 *   POSTPONE → `ops/shipments/hold`, which already holds a confirmed order
 *              back to a date without rewinding its confirmation
 *
 * Nothing new decides, nothing new moves money, and nothing new writes a
 * state. This file only says which of the three doors an approval opens.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe: the dialog reads it to decide what to offer.
