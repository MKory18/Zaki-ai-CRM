/**
 * «أجّل» ASKED FOR NO DATE, AND NOTHING EVER BROUGHT THE ORDER BACK.
 *
 * Two faults, and I caused the second one myself.
 *
 *   THE HOLD HAD NO END. `until` was optional and a missing one stored the
 *   year 2999. `shipHoldUntil` is read by two files, the shipment list
 *   simply excludes anything held, and nothing anywhere announces a held
 *   order or returns it. A parcel held «for now» by somebody who then went
 *   on leave was gone — with its goods still reserved against it.
 *
 *   AND THE ROW HAD TWO BUTTONS FOR ONE THOUGHT. «أجّل» and «للمتابعة»,
 *   added in the previous batch, both read as postponing. Nobody at a
 *   packing table can decode «the first keeps the goods reserved and the
 *   confirmation standing, the second undoes both» from two labels before
 *   pressing one.
 *
 * The distinction is real and it is kept. It moved out of the button names
 * and into a sentence at the moment of choosing — which is also the only
 * place a person has the facts to choose with.
