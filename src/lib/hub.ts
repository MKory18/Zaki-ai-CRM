/**
 * WHAT A HUB IS ASKED, AND ANSWERED IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * The sidebar draws a hub as one line and the strip above a screen draws its
 * siblings, and both have to agree about three things: which hub a page is in,
 * where the line leads, and what the line is called. Asked separately they
 * would drift — the line would say «الإدارة» while the strip said something
 * else — so the sidebar and the strip both read this.
 *
 * Pure, and it takes the groups it is GIVEN: the menu this person actually
 * has, already stripped of what they may not open and already arranged the
 * way they arranged it. So a pill never appears for a screen they cannot
 * open, and their own order and hiding apply to the strip as they do to the
 * sidebar. See `NavGroup.hub` for what the three kinds of group are.
