/**
 * THE PAPER BEHIND A COLLECTION.
 *
 * A courier hands over money and the amount goes into a wallet. Until now
 * the only record of WHY that figure is that figure was the number itself
 * and an optional sentence — so a receipt for 1,240 and a receipt for 1,420
 * look equally true a month later, and the only way to settle it is to ring
 * the courier.
 *
 * So the photo of the handover slip, or the bank's transfer PDF, is kept
 * with the row. The owner asked for it in those words: «حط رفع ملف صورة او
 * ملف عشان اتحقق من التحصيل».
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT TEN LINES IN THE ROUTE ──
 *
 * Four of the five rules below are the kind that look like one line and are
 * not: what counts as an image, what the file is named when it comes back
 * out, where it is allowed to be written, and whether a PDF may be opened
 * in the tab or must be downloaded. Each one has a way of being wrong that
 * a route-level `if` hides. They are here so they can be TESTED without a
 * database, a request or a logged-in user.
 *
 * WHAT IS REUSED RATHER THAN REWRITTEN: `detectImageType` already sniffs
 * jpeg, png and webp by their magic bytes in `storage.ts`, and
 * `isSafeStorageKey` already decides whether a key escapes the uploads
 * root. Writing a second copy of either is how two answers to one question
 * start. Only the PDF is new here, because nothing else in this product
 * accepts one.
 */

/**
 * FOUR MEGABYTES, AND THE REASON IS THE TRANSPORT, NOT THE DISK.
 *
 * The proof travels in the same JSON body as the receipt — base64, the way
 * the courier's statement already arrives on the route next door — so the
 * receipt and its paper are ONE transaction. A receipt written and a proof
 * that then fails to upload is exactly the state this feature exists to
 * prevent. Base64 costs a third, so 4 MB of photo is about 5.6 MB of body.
 *
 * A phone camera will exceed this; the dialog is where that gets shrunk, so
 * the refusal says the size in megabytes rather than in bytes.
