 *
 * WHY THE SIX DIGITS ARE ASKED FOR SO OFTEN, MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED:
 * a screen untouched for twenty minutes signs the account out
 * (`IDLE_LIMIT_MS`), and every sign-in verifies the second factor again. An
 * owner who puts a laptop down between two meetings reaches for the phone
 * three or four times a day — and a rule reached for that often is a rule
 * people start working around, which is how a second factor ends up
 * switched off for everybody.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHAT IT CANNOT ──
 *
 * A trusted device stands in for the SIX DIGITS. It never stands in for the
 * password. Somebody holding this device and not the password gets nowhere;
 * somebody holding the password and not this device is asked for the code
 * exactly as before. That is the whole security argument, and it is the
 * reason the feature is safe to want: the second factor is not being
 * removed, the *possession* of the enrolled device is being remembered.
 *
 * ── HOW TRUST ENDS, WITHOUT A REVOCATION LIST ──
 *
 * The trust is a signed token the device holds, not a row. It carries the
 * moment the authenticator was enrolled (`enr`), so:
 *
 *   · resetting or re-enrolling 2FA changes `totpEnabledAt` and every
 *     trusted device in the world stops being trusted, at once
 *   · a different person signing in on the device finds `sub` is not theirs
 *   · thirty days pass and the token expires on its own
 *
 * No table to keep in step, and nothing to forget to clean up. What it
 * cannot do is revoke ONE device from a screen — that needs a row, and it
 * is written here as a known limit rather than left to be discovered.
 *
 * SIGNING OUT DOES NOT FORGET THE DEVICE, which is deliberate and is how
 * every bank behaves: leaving is not the same as saying «this is not my
 * laptop». The password is still asked for on the way back in.

/**

 *
 * It is the one signal this deployment actually has. Addresses are not one
 * of them: without `TRUST_PROXY=true` every caller shares the bucket
 * `'local'` (see `getClientIp`), so «a new IP» would be either always true
 * or always false, and a signal that cannot vary is worse than none — it
 * reads as a protection while protecting nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS WHEN IT FIRES WRONGLY: a typo costs one code entry. That
 * is the trade, stated so it can be changed if it grates — the counter is
 * deliberately NOT cleared by a later success, because «somebody guessed
 * wrong at this account minutes ago» stays true whoever typed next.
 *
 * AND IT CAN BE PROVOKED: anybody who knows an email can fail a password on
 * purpose and force the owner to reach for their phone. That is a nuisance
