/**
 * WHAT IS WAITING FOR ME, IN THE BAR AT THE TOP OF EVERY SCREEN.
 *
 * The header already carried one number, and it was the right idea applied
 * to one role: «how many orders are waiting to be pulled» for whoever
 * pulls. Everybody else got a bar that was identical whatever their job —
 * a shipping clerk with forty parcels ready to go, a warehouse with a
 * pallet of returns nobody has counted in, an owner with change requests
 * sitting past their deadline, all looking at the same store name and the
 * same bell.
 *
 * So the one number becomes a small set, and the server still decides which
 * of them a person sees — by permission, exactly as the counter did. What
 * changes is that the question is now «what is waiting for YOU» rather than
 * «is confirmation busy».
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A LIST. A count and a link to the screen that owns it. A
 * header that opened a list would be a second door into data with its own
 * idea of who may walk through it, which is the reasoning the confirmation
 * counter was written with and it has not changed.
 *
 * AND IT IS SHORT ON PURPOSE. Seven controls in a 375-pixel bar is how a
 * bell gets missed and a logout gets hit — the header's own comment, and
 * it is right. A phone shows the single most urgent; a desk shows three.
