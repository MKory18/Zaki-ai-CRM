/**
 * تشطيب ١ — STAGE 1: THE COMMITMENTS LEDGER, the frontend. The eighth and
 * last section.
 *
 * «The UI computes nothing the backend already computes. It NEVER calculates
 *  COD, delivery fee, discount allocation, available stock, days in transit,
 *  SLA remaining, commission, profit, delivery rate, risk tier, or expected
 *  settlement amount. If a value is missing from a response, extend the
 *  endpoint. A number that exists in two places will diverge.»
 *                      — invariants.md, `## Frontend`
 *
 * ELEVEN FIGURES, NOT TWELVE. The sentence names eleven: COD, delivery fee,
 * discount allocation, available stock, days in transit, SLA remaining,
 * commission, profit, delivery rate, risk tier, expected settlement amount.
 * Counted twice because the brief asked for twelve and a missing twelfth
 * would otherwise read as a figure nobody checked.
 *
 * SEVEN HOLD. FOUR ARE DIVERGED, and they are pinned AS THEY ARE and
 * reported rather than resolved — «A DIVERGED or CONFLICT item is reported,
 * not resolved.»
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT COUNTS AS «COMPUTING», AND WHAT DOES NOT.
 *
 * The rule is about BUSINESS figures. Three kinds of arithmetic in a
 * component are legitimate, and every one of them exists in this tree, so
 * the distinction has to be written down rather than left to whoever reads
 * the next sweep:
 *
 *   1 · AN INPUT ECHO. The sum of prices a moderator is typing into a form
 *       for an order that does not exist yet. There is no server figure to
 *       render, because there is nothing on the server. `ProductLinesEditor`
 *       calls this «قيمة البضاعة» and says in its own header that the COD is
 *       the server's. A number computed from the user's own keystrokes is
 *       not a second copy of anything.
 *
 *   2 · A UNIT CONVERSION OR A FORMAT. `Math.round(risk.returnRate * 100)`
 *       turns the server's 0.22 into «22%». The figure is the server's; only
 *       the notation is the screen's. Likewise a progress bar's width, a
 *       grid's column count, a character counter, and a clock that ticks.
 *
 *   3 · THE ONE PURE FUNCTION, CALLED FROM BOTH SIDES.
 *       `ManufacturingScreen` imports `batchTotal` and `batchUnitCost` from
 *       `product-cost.ts` — the same two functions `/api/production` calls.
 *       That is not the UI computing; that is the UI using the one
 *       implementation. Its own comment records why: «This used to add the
 *       buckets and the lines here and divide to two places, while the
 *       server records four — so the unit cost somebody watched while typing
 *       could differ from the one written down.»
 *
 * What is NOT legitimate is a screen applying a RULE — the COD branch, the
 * partial-delivery fee, the per-unit discount, the settlement expectation —
 * to numbers the server already applied it to. That is the second copy, and
 * «a number that exists in two places will diverge» is not a prediction
 * here. Three of the four divergences below are measured, in this file,
 * against the server's own functions.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE DOES NOT USE `dashboardFiles()`.
 *
 * `guard-source.SELLER_SURFACES` excludes the landing pages, the storefront
 * and the public pages, and it is right to: those are a rule about COLOURS
 * and FONTS, and the dashboard's palette has no business overwriting a
 * seller's brand. Money is not like that. A shopper's basket that adds up
 * its own total diverges from the door exactly as badly as an operations
 * screen does — worse, because the customer read the number. So the sweep
 * here is over EVERY `.tsx` under `src/components` and `src/app`, and
 * `components/landing/OrderForm.tsx` is in the swept set below because of
 * it. Reaching for `dashboardFiles()` would have dropped the one surface a
 * customer actually sees.
