/**
 * A STORE, SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE.
 *
 * The store already existed — it is what an order belongs to, what a user
 * has access to, what a landing page sits inside. It simply had no public
 * face. This gives it one, and deliberately gives it nothing else: no second
 * product catalogue, no second offer system, no second order path. A
 * storefront is a view of what the company already sells.
 *
 * Two shapes from one model, because `Store.type` already said which:
 *
 *   SINGLE_PRODUCT — the home page IS a landing page: the one the seller
 *                    picked as the store's front, with every block, template,
 *                    pixel and upsell it has. No catalogue, no cart. Until a
 *                    page is picked, it is its one product's page.
 *   MULTI_PRODUCT  — home lists what is for sale, each with its own page.
 *
 * Everything is read through THIS store. The catalogue used to be read by
 * company, so one shop listed — and sold — another shop's products, and the
 * order landed on the wrong shop's stock.
 *
 * Only ACTIVE products with a price are listed. A product with no price is
 * not a product a customer can buy, and showing it teaches them the shop is
 * broken.
