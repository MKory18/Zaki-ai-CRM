/**
 * تشطيب ٢ — PASS 2: «If the same figure is computed in two different places
 * in the code, that is a defect even when the two agree today.»
 *
 * The audit traces one order's number: order detail COD → preparation →
 * manifest → label → tracking → statement → receipt → matching → wallet →
 * closing → profit → commission. Every stop must show the same figure.
 *
 * This file guards the part of that chain which is decided by CODE rather
 * than by data: that there is one rounding rule, and that the money WRITTEN
 * onto an order goes through it.
 *
 * WHAT WAS FOUND. `add-product` — the post-order upsell, the one door that
 * changes an order's money after the order exists — rounded with
 * `.toFixed(2)`. The figure it produced was written three times: the add-on
 * row, the order's `totalAmount` (which is what the courier is told to
 * collect) and the landing page's `upsellRevenue`. On the Jordanian store in
 * this database the currency is JOD, **minorUnit 3**, so 1.234 was stored as
 * 1.23 — a fils lost, and three rows disagreeing with the product they came
 * from and with the courier's manifest.
