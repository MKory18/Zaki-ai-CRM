/**
 * THE SAME OFFER, THE SAME PRICE, WHICHEVER DOOR IT CAME THROUGH.
 *
 * An Offer carries `sellingPrice`, `discount` and `quantity`. Two doors
 * create orders and both call the same `computeCod`:
 *
 *   `/api/orders` — the confirmation agent on the phone — passed
 *     `computeCod({ ..., discount: offer?.discount ?? 0, ... })`
 *   `createPublicOrder` — the landing page and the storefront — passed
 *     **no discount at all**.
 *
 * So an offer with `sellingPrice: 25` and `discount: 3` cost 22 by phone
 * and 25 from the landing page. `totalAmount` is what the waybill carries
 * and what the courier is told to collect, so the customer handed over the
 * undiscounted figure, and the per-line `discountShare` was written as 0 —
 * which is also what a partial return would have refunded against.
 *
 * The owner's ruling: pass it, exactly as the manual door does.
 *
 * WHAT WAS CHECKED BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING, because getting either
 * backwards makes this worse than it was:
 *
 *   `discount` is an ABSOLUTE amount, not a percentage. `allocateDiscount`
 *   clamps it with `Math.min(discount, subtotal)` and the admin form
 *   validates it as `money(1_000_000)`. A percentage would be clamped
 *   against a subtotal, which is meaningless.
 *
 *   The landing page does NOT already subtract it. The string `discount`
 *   does not occur anywhere under `src/components/landing/`, nor in
 *   `storefront.ts`, nor in any public route; `activeOffersFor` does not
 *   even select the column, so `OfferView` cannot carry it to a browser.
 *   What the page strikes through is `compareAtPrice`, which `offers.ts`
 *   keeps deliberately apart from this: «One is a marketing number and must
 *   never touch the money.» So there is no double discount to create.
