/**
 * تشطيب ٢ — PASS 3: «blacklist a phone → blocked across ALL stores and
 * countries?» and «submit a landing page form from a blacklisted phone → no
 * order, neutral message?»
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS YES, AND IT TOOK TWO HOPS TO SEE IT — which is why this file
 * exists. `telegram/order-creation.ts` creates an order and contains no
 * blacklist check at all; I read it and wrote down that the Telegram channel
 * was a hole. It is not: `telegram/inbound.ts` checks one level up, before it
 * ever calls the creator, with a comment about why it passes the RAW phone.
 *
 * A fact that takes two hops to establish is a fact the next person will get
 * wrong the same way. So the doors are enumerated here with the file the
 * check actually lives in, and a door that stops checking fails.
