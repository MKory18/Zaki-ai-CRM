/**
 * WHO KNOWS WHAT, AND THEREFORE WHO WRITES WHAT.
 *
 * Recording a delivery at the tracking screen used to write
 * `collectedAmount` — and that is the one figure nobody on that screen can
 * know. A follow-up agent is repeating what a courier said on the phone; the
 * money is what the courier's own statement says arrived.
 *
 * It was worse than an approximation. The statement sweep only promotes
 * orders still in flight, so an order settled at the door left the set the
 * statement checks. Recording a delivery did not anticipate the
 * reconciliation — it CANCELLED it, and the typed figure was never once
 * compared with the courier's.
 *
 * The file that did the promoting even said so out loud: «an order already
 * marked delivered keeps its own date and amount, because whoever stood
 * there and recorded it knew more than a spreadsheet does». Half true. They
 * know WHAT HAPPENED — who took which line, what came back, why — and no
 * statement carries that. They do not know WHAT MONEY ARRIVED.
 *
 * So the line is drawn there: the door records the event, the statement
 * records the money, and the statement now reaches the orders the door
 * closed by hand — otherwise the amount would stay null for ever.
