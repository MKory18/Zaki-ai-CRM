/**
 * THE THANK-YOU SCREEN, SHARED BY ALL TEN STRUCTURES.
 *
 * «صفحة الشكر مشتركة بين العشرة» — so it is one screen in one component,
 * and the structures differ in the story that leads to it and in nothing
 * after the order is placed.
 *
 * MOST OF THIS STAGE ALREADY EXISTED and the useful work was finding out
 * which parts. The post-order offer is a mature, signed-token endpoint; the
 * commission rule that keeps it off an agent's cross-sell is structural and
 * was written long before this brief. What was missing was smaller and
 * entirely about what the customer is told: when they pay, how to reach a
 * person, and how to say no.
