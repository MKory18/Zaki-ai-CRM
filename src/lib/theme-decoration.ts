/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * DECORATION, AND THE THREE PLACES IT IS ALLOWED.
 *
 * Twelve themes, and nine of them are MOODS — neon, gold, parchment,
 * a sky with no moon. A mood that is nothing but thirty-four hexes is a
 * recoloured spreadsheet, so each theme may put an ambient touch on the
 * screen. And then the rule that matters:
 *
 *   ⚠️ NEVER WHERE THE DATA IS.
 *
 * Not behind a table, not behind a form, not behind an order, a figure of
 * money or a stock count. A glow under a column of numbers is a glow
 * somebody has to read through, every row, all day — and the person
 * reading it is deciding whether to ship something. The brand earns
 * attention at the door; inside, the numbers do.
 *
 * So there are exactly three places, and they are the three where nothing
 * is being measured or decided:
 *
 *   • `door`    — sign in, pick a country, pick a store, the splash.
 *   • `empty`   — a list with nothing in it yet.
 *   • `sidebar` — the header above the menu, where the wordmark sits.
 *
 * `a-theme-is-not-a-mood-swing.test.ts` sweeps every screen that renders
 * orders, money or stock and fails if one of them draws any of this.
 *
 * ── AND IT COSTS THE STYLESHEET NOTHING ──
 *
 * `decorCss` is written into the document by `SystemFrame`, beside the one
 * palette that person chose — the same reason, the same place. Somebody
 * who turned decoration off downloads none of it, and the first-load
 * stylesheet that reaches everybody does not grow by a byte. See
 * `SHEET_THEMES` in system-themes.ts.

 * AND THE ORNAMENT EACH THEME WEARS — SHAPE ONLY, NEVER COLOUR.
 *
 * Eleven drawings live in `public/brand/decor/<key>.webp`, one per theme:
 * a radar sweep, a girih star, an orbit, a laurel, a compass. They are
 * **masks** — one channel of coverage, no colour at all — and the colour
 * is painted through them from `--sys-primary`.
 *
 * That is not a size trick, though it is also that (440 KB for all eleven
 * instead of 1.6 MB, and one of them reaches one person). It is the rule
 * three paragraphs up, kept: «a decoration with a hex of its own is a
 * twelfth palette nobody measured». A full-colour picture carries its own
 * greens and golds that no palette test ever looks at, and it would stay
 * that colour when the theme's primary changed. A mask cannot drift,
 * because it has nothing to drift with.
 *
 * ── AND THE MIDDLE OF EVERY ONE OF THEM IS EMPTY ──
 *
 * Each mask fades to nothing across the middle fifth of the frame, so
 * every ornament is a FRAME rather than a picture. The three places all
 * put their content in the centre — the sign-in card, the empty state's
 * sentence, the sidebar's wordmark — so the hole is exactly where the
 * reading happens. It is cut into the art, not asked for in CSS, because
 * the one thing a background must never do is sit between a person and a
 * number.
 *
 * ── AND HOW LOUD EACH ONE IS, IS MEASURED ──
 *
 * Not chosen. Each mask was weighed by how much LIGHT it moves against
 * its own theme's background — the same quantity a contrast ratio is
 * built from — and given the opacity that lands all eleven on one target.
 * That is why these numbers are not round: `epic`'s gold on charcoal is
 * the biggest brightness gap in the set and lands at 0.36, while `cyber`'s
 * hairline on black cannot reach the target at all and is left whole.
 *
 * Measured, so the louder art is quieter by arithmetic rather than by
 * somebody squinting at it once — and so a replacement drawing cannot
 * quietly arrive at the wrong volume: re-run the measurement and this
 * table changes with it.

 * A THEME THAT WEARS THREE DRAWINGS, NOT ONE.
 *
 * The owner, 21/10: «الشكل خرافي مستوحى من الإسلامي حتى الرسوميات». One
 * mask behind a sign-in card is a pattern; the two Islamic themes are
 * meant to be a PLACE — a rosette to stand in front of, a corner of vine
 * and strapwork at each top corner, and a city's roofline along the
 * bottom. Each is its own drawing (`<key>.rosette.webp`, `.corner.webp`,
 * `.skyline.webp`), all masks, all painted from `--sys-primary`, so the
 * rule above holds for every one of them: no colour of their own.
 *
 * ── WHERE EACH GOES, AND WHY NOT ANYWHERE ELSE ──
 *
 *   door     rosette centred, a corner in each top corner, the skyline on
 *            the bottom edge. The corners and the skyline sit at the
 *            VIEWPORT'S edges, where nothing is ever drawn, so they work
 *            at any width — a frame around the card would have needed the
 *            card to be one size.
 *   empty    the rosette alone, fitted to the box. A list with nothing in
 *            it is the other place that is not measuring anything.
 *   sidebar  one corner, at the end of the header away from the wordmark.
 *
 * Never behind a figure. `a-theme-is-not-a-mood-swing.test.ts` sweeps the
 * screens for that and is not touched.
 *
 * ── THE LEFT CORNER IS THE RIGHT ONE, TURNED ──
 *
 * One drawing, mirrored by `transform: scaleX(-1)` on the layer that
 * carries it. A second file of the same drawing would be 68 KB of the same
 * bytes, for a person who only ever sees one of them at a time.
 *
 * ── AND THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE CHOSEN, NOT MEASURED ──
 *
 * The eleven single masks were weighed by the light they move and given the
 * opacity that put them on one target (above). That worked for one mask
 * behind a card and it did not survive a browser: a proof sheet of 260px
 * tiles measured a kinder screen than the real door, and the first build
 * put a radar through the wordmark. These three are set by eye, in a
 * browser, at 1920, 1280 and 390 pixels wide, over the real card size.
 * The corners and the skyline are quieter than they look and the rosette
 * quieter still, because the rosette is the one that sits where text is.
 *
 * The CSS below does exactly one thing differently from a single mask: it
 * hides the circuit-wave banner the door draws under everything
 * (`.zk-door-banner`), because a door that brings its own picture should
 * not be wearing another one beneath it.

/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE THEMES THAT WEAR PHOTOGRAPHS — THE ONE PLACE «MASKS ONLY» IS BROKEN,
 * AND WHAT HOLDS IN ITS PLACE.
 *
 * The rule above — shape only, never colour — was written for a reason that
 * still stands: «a decoration with a hex of its own is a twelfth palette
 * nobody measured», because a full-colour picture carries greens and golds
 * that no palette test ever looks at. The owner, 21/10, asked for exactly
 * that anyway, for one theme: «ثيم جي تي ايه بصور حقيقية» — and decided where
 * («بالأماكن التلاتة بس»). So `neon-coast` wears three real photographs of a
 * beachfront at the blue hour.
 *
 * And on 23/10/2026 the owner approved opening the same list to a second
 * theme, «ليل» (`layl` — the theme a new member of staff opens on), so that
 * the real pictures made for it are actually seen: the courtyard gate at
 * night, the road to the kasbah, and the empty-list family. That approval is
 * the only reason the list has two names, and the claim that holds the list
 * names both on purpose. What the rule protected is protected the same way
 * for the two of them:
 *
 *   • THE LIST IS CLOSED. `PHOTOGRAPHIC` below has two keys, and
 *     a-photographic-theme-keeps-its-text-readable.test.ts fails if a third
 *     appears without somebody editing that claim on purpose.
 *   • THE THREE PLACES ARE THE SAME THREE. Nothing here is drawn by another
 *     component, and never behind a table, a form, an order, a figure of
 *     money or a stock count — the sweep in a-theme-is-not-a-mood-swing.test.ts
 *     still runs over every screen that draws any of this.
 *   • THE TEXT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE PICTURE. A picture can be replaced by
 *     anybody, and the numbers beside it nudged by anybody reading them as
 *     taste, so — like the door's own banner — every number below is held by
 *     a test that composites PURE WHITE, the worst picture there could be,
 *     through the same numbers and asks whether the dimmest text still clears
 *     4.5:1. The picture is mood; the colour under the words is the page's.
 *
 * ── WHAT EACH PLACE DOES ──
 *
 *   door     the wide picture, or the portrait one on a phone (a browser asks
 *            for only the one that matches, so nobody downloads both), under a
 *            veil of the page's own colour. The door's text column becomes a
 *            panel of that colour at `panel` — and that panel, not the picture,
 *            is what every word of the sign-in page is read against. Without
 *            it the paragraph under the card lands on lit windows on a phone.
 *   empty    the same picture at `empty` opacity behind the empty list's
 *            sentence, faded to nothing at its edges by a mask.
 *   sidebar  the 5:1 strip across the header of the menu, under a veil that is
 *            heaviest where the wordmark is. In a right-to-left layout that is
 *            the right-hand side, and the strip was shot with its calm sea on
 *            the right for that reason.
 *
 * ── AND WHAT «ليل» DOES DIFFERENTLY, AND WHY ──
 *
 *   door     the same arrangement: the courtyard gate at night (the wide
 *            picture) or the road to the kasbah (the portrait one, made as a
 *            loading panel and standing here because a phone is a portrait
 *            door), under a veil and with a panel of the page's own colour
 *            under every word.
 *   empty    not one picture but one per FAMILY of screen — the bell on the
 *            confirmation queue, the tied parcel on preparation, the map on
 *            shipment tracking, the scales on matching and collection, the
 *            money office on the rest of the money, the crate on returns and
 *            stock, the warehouse on receiving and production, and the
 *            magnifier everywhere else. The family is read from the address
 *            by `emptyFamilyOf` below and written once, on the shell's main
 *            element, as `data-empty-family`. The layer that shows it is
 *            still the one EmptyState draws and nothing else: no fourth
 *            place, no picture element, no change to EmptyState.
 *            And the picture lies on a POOL of the page's own darkest colour,
 *            laid by the layer itself — because «ليل»'s palette leaves no
 *            room on its lightest surface: its primary on `surface` measures
 *            4.48:1 before any picture at all, so a picture laid straight onto
 *            that surface (white being the worst picture there could be)
 *            would take the action link under the bar at any strength. On the
 *            pool the words are read against `--sys-background`, which is what
 *            the claim composites the white picture over.
 *   sidebar  no strip was made for «ليل», so the header keeps the theme's own
 *            drawing — the corner of its octagram lattice, painted from
 *            `--sys-primary` at its measured `DECOR_INK`, exactly as a theme
 *            with a single mask draws it there.
 *
 * ── AND WHAT IT COSTS ──
 *
 * The stylesheet nothing, like every other ornament: written by `SystemFrame`
 * for the one theme rendered. Each picture is under 120 KB, a person is sent
 * one of the two door pictures, not both, and an empty list asks for the one
 * picture of its own family — a rule that matches no element downloads
 * nothing. At «full» the door zooms — very slowly, from its centre, so no edge
 * is ever uncovered — and the other two stand still: a layer that DRIFTS shows
 * a seam of page along one side, which is fine for a wash and wrong for a
 * photograph.
 *
 * `color-mix()` is how the veil is made from the theme's own tokens, so no
 * hex is written here. A browser too old to know it drops the whole
 * declaration, and what it then shows is the plain wash — a door with no
 * picture, never a picture with no veil.
