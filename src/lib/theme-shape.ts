/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A THEME IS A SHAPE TOO — AND THE SHAPE IS THE FRAME, NEVER THE FIGURE.
 *
 * Twelve palettes made the product twelve colours. The owner's reference
 * screens are not eleven colours: a card under «إسلامي» wears a pointed
 * arch, one under «سايبربنك» has a cut corner and a hard edge, one under
 * «فخامة» a thin gold hairline. That is what makes a theme read as a
 * theme instead of as a filter.
 *
 * ── AND THE LINE THE OWNER DREW HIMSELF ──
 *
 * «ولا رسمة ورا رقم أو مبلغ.» So nothing here goes behind the content:
 *
 *   • the RADIUS and the BORDER are the card's own edge — they cannot sit
 *     under a figure, because they are the frame around it;
 *   • the CROWN is drawn on the top edge, outside the padding;
 *   • the MARK is a small faint glyph in the card's top-left corner — the
 *     corner furthest from the heading in RTL — at 7% of a colour that is
 *     already the card's border. It is a background, so it is behind
 *     everything, catches no click and is announced to nobody;
 *   • the FRIEZE (the two Islamic themes only) is a band of eight-point stars
 *     and lozenges along the top edge, eight pixels tall — a BACKGROUND in
 *     the card's own top padding (a card's header is 16px from the edge, a
 *     full-bleed table's first row 12px), so it is beneath everything and
 *     beside no figure. The crown is painted over it, which makes a doorway
 *     of the middle.
 *
 * Illustrations — the sunset, the mountains, the planet — stay in the
 * three places decoration is allowed and on the welcome card. Those are
 * `theme-decoration.ts`, and they are a different thing from this.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE ARRANGEMENT IS NOT A THEME'S BUSINESS. The owner ruled on it:
 * «الترتيب بيضل لصاحبه، والثيم للشكل بس.» Somebody arranges their
 * dashboard, then changes theme — and if the theme re-ordered it, the
 * theme would have eaten their work. A theme moves surfaces, now shapes,
 * and never the order of anything.
 *
 * ── AND IT COSTS THE STYLESHEET NOTHING ──
 *
 * Written into the document by `SystemFrame` beside the one palette that
 * person chose, for the same reason: see `SHEET_THEMES` in
 * system-themes.ts. Eleven shapes in the first-load sheet would be weight
 * on everybody for the one they picked. The owner's «ضمن سقف ورقة
 * الأنماط» is met by the sheet not growing at all.
