/**
 * DEDUCTIONS — WHAT MAY BE CHARGED, AND WHAT MAY NEVER BE.
 *
 * This is the most dangerous file added to this system, because everything
 * else here reports and this takes money. Four things hold it in place:
 *
 * 1. The system PROPOSES. A person APPLIES. No deduction becomes money
 *    because a job ran at midnight — the same rule every other movement in
 *    this system lives by, and for the same reason: the machine cannot know
 *    there was a funeral, a closed road, or a shift swapped by phone.
 *
 * 2. A measurement that is an ESTIMATE may not be charged at all. Lateness
 *    taken from the first order somebody touched is an upper bound — they
 *    were at their desk before that, and nobody knows how long before.
 *    Charging an upper bound is not a policy; it is an error with a receipt.
 *
 * 3. Grace and a cap, on every rule. A rule with no grace charges somebody
 *    every day traffic exists, and a deduction that happens daily stops
 *    being a signal about anything. A rule with no cap can eat a salary
 *    over one illness.
 *
 * 4. Nothing is deleted. A wrong deduction is REVERSED by a linked opposite
 *    row, so the record shows that it happened and that it was undone.
