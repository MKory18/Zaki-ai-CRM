# Courier integrations

One courier is handled by a person today: someone hands over the parcels,
writes the tracking number on the shipment screen, and updates the status
from what the courier says. `manual.ts` is that, written down.

An automated courier is a second implementation of `CourierAdapter` in
`types.ts` and nothing else. Register it in `index.ts`, then switch
`apiEnabled` on for that provider — until someone does, the provider stays
manual, which is the safe default.

## The rule that does not bend

A courier reports what it observed. **We** decide what it means.

`COURIER_CANNOT_ASSERT` holds `DELIVERED`, `RETURNED` and `CANCELLED`. A feed
may never set those, and `mapStatus` must return `null` for any code it does
not recognise rather than guessing a near match. DELIVERED makes commission
accrue and money expected from the courier; RETURNED reverses it. Moving
money because of a string we do not understand is the one failure that cannot
be undone with an apology, so both stay a human decision taken against the
courier's own statement.

In-transit statuses (`SHIPPED`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `FAILED_DELIVERY`) move no
money and may be applied automatically — through the normal transition
machine in `shipping-workflow.ts`, never by writing the column directly.

## LogesTechs — built

`logestechs.ts`, against their API documentation (v. 9-6-2026).
Base `https://apisv2.logestechs.com/api`. Authentication is the account email
and password in each request body, not a token, so the credentials live in
the environment and never in a database row.

| What | Their endpoint |
|---|---|
| Create shipment | `POST /ship/request/by-email` |
| City id for an address | `GET /addresses/cities?search=` |
| One package's status | `GET /guests/packages/status?barcode=` |
| AWB labels | `POST /guests/{companyId}/packages/pdf` |
| Cancel | `PUT /guests/{companyId}/packages/cancel?barcode=` |

Two details of their contract worth keeping in mind: their `cod` is the
amount **including** delivery, which is exactly our COD; and their
`invoiceNumber` is the merchant's own order number, so our `merchantRef`
goes there — it is the key their statement comes back with, and the key
matching reads.

### Status mapping

`LOGESTECHS_STATUS` maps their codes only where the meaning is unambiguous.
Their driver-assignment, shelf and partner-transfer codes say where the
parcel is inside *their* operation, not what has happened to it from our
side, so they map to `null` and nothing is applied. `DELIVERED_TO_RECIPIENT`
and `RETURNED_BY_RECIPIENT` do map, but `COURIER_CANNOT_ASSERT` still refuses
to apply them automatically: those two decide whether money is owed, and a
person confirms them against the statement.

`PARTIALLY_DELIVERED` is deliberately `null` until Stage 9 — a partial
delivery needs the amount actually collected, and guessing it would settle
the wrong figure.

### Turning it on

The adapter registers itself only when every required variable is set;
otherwise the provider stays manual rather than failing at the first call.

```
LOGESTECHS_EMAIL=
LOGESTECHS_PASSWORD=
LOGESTECHS_COMPANY_ID=
LOGESTECHS_SENDER_NAME=
LOGESTECHS_SENDER_PHONE=
LOGESTECHS_SENDER_BUSINESS=      # optional
LOGESTECHS_ORIGIN_ADDRESS=
LOGESTECHS_ORIGIN_ADDRESS2=      # optional
LOGESTECHS_ORIGIN_CITY_ID=       # from GET /addresses/cities
LOGESTECHS_SERVICE_TYPE_ID=      # optional, as their account was set up
LOGESTECHS_VEHICLE_TYPE_ID=      # optional
LOGESTECHS_PARCEL_TYPE_ID=       # optional
LOGESTECHS_BASE_URL=             # optional override
```

Then set the provider's `code` to `LOGESTECHS` and turn `apiEnabled` on for
it. Until someone does both, it is handled manually.

Still worth asking them for: whether they can push status changes by webhook,
what they sign the payload with, and their retry behaviour. Without it the
Stage 7 worker polls `GET /guests/packages/status` per barcode, which works
but is slower and chattier than being told.
