 * The seam every courier integration plugs into.
 *
 * Today one courier is handled by a human typing a tracking number and
 * updating the status; LogesTechs would be a second implementation of THIS
 * interface and nothing else. Writing the boundary now is what stops the
 * first real integration from scattering courier-specific branches through
 * the shipment, tracking and settlement code.
 *
 * The rule that matters: a courier tells us what it observed, and we decide
 * what that means. No adapter writes an order status directly — it returns
 * events, the caller applies them through the normal transition machine.

/**
 * «IT FAILED» AND «I DO NOT KNOW» ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS.
 *
 * A refused request — bad phone, unknown city, wrong password — is a
 * failure whose outcome is KNOWN: nothing was created, and retrying is
 * free. A request that timed out is not: the courier may have made the
 * parcel and simply not told us in time. Retrying that one books a second
 * waybill for goods that already have one, and the first barcode becomes a
 * parcel nothing in here can name.
 *
 * Any adapter that cannot know marks its error, and whoever retries reads
 * the mark. A message string would do the same job until somebody rewords
 * it, so it is a property.
