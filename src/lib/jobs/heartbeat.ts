/**
 * IS THE SCHEDULER ALIVE?
 *
 * The worker (scripts/worker.ts) is a SEPARATE PROCESS from the web app.
 * That is deliberate — but it means the app has no idea whether it is
 * running. Nothing crashes, nothing 500s, no screen turns red: the orders
 * simply stop being released back to the shared stock, the courier statuses
 * stop updating, the closing reminder stops arriving, and everybody assumes
 * it is a quiet day. This is the failure that motivated this file: a dead
 * worker is INVISIBLE, and an app that answers 200 while the worker is dead
 * buys false confidence, which is worse than no monitoring at all.
 *
 * The only trace the worker leaves is the run log — `JobRun`. So liveness is
 * answered the same way the schedule itself is answered: from the rows the
 * worker wrote, not from a variable a restart resets.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE THREE JOB NAMES, COPIED RATHER THAN DERIVED ──
 *
 * The honest heartbeat is "a job that fires every minute has fired
 * recently". Three jobs in `definitions.ts` have `everySeconds: 60`, so a
 * living worker writes a `JobRun` row at least once a minute.
 *
 * The names are COPIED here instead of being computed from `JOBS` on
 * purpose, and both reasons matter:
 *
 *   - `definitions.ts` pulls in commission accrual, backups, ad-spend
 *     providers, courier clients — the whole business. A health endpoint
 *     that cannot even be IMPORTED because an unrelated module threw at
 *     load time is a health endpoint that reports nothing exactly when
 *     something is wrong. This file imports the database client and nothing
 *     else.
 *   - It is polled every minute forever. Paying for that import graph on
 *     every cold start, for three string constants, is not a trade worth
 *     making.
 *
 * The copy cannot drift silently: `heartbeat.test.ts` asserts these are
 * still exactly the 60-second interval jobs in `JOBS`, and fails the build
 * if someone renames, retimes or removes one.

 * name, merged, stopping at the first row — no table access, no sort, no
 * count, and flat as the run log grows to millions of rows. Measured

 *
 * NOTE what is deliberately NOT here: no `count()`, no "last run of every

 * be a second round trip to learn what this query already proves — if it
 * returned, the database is up. One query answers both questions.
 *
