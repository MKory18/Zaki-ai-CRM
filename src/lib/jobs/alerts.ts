/**
 * WHEN A SCHEDULED JOB STOPS WORKING, SOMEBODY HAS TO BE TOLD.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS ACTUALLY THERE BEFORE THIS FILE ──
 *
 * `scripts/worker.ts` already counted consecutive failures, already knew
 * about `ALERT_AFTER_FAILURES`, and already had a branch that said the job
 * "needs intervention". That branch called `console.log`.
 *
 * A `console.log` in a detached worker process is not an alert. On this
 * deployment the worker runs under pm2 or systemd, so that line lands in a
 * file on the server that nobody opens unless they already suspect
 * something — which is the one thing an alert exists to replace. The
 * commission accrual could fail every hour for a week and the only trace a
 * human would ever see is the jobs screen, if a human happened to open it.
 *
 * So the alert was MISSING, not broken: everything up to the last inch was
 * built, and the last inch went to a log file.
 *
 * ── THE LINK IS NOT DECORATION ──
 *
 * The brief requires a link, and the reason is the difference between being
 * woken up and being able to act. "accrue-commission failed" at 03:00 on a
 * phone, with no link, means finding a laptop, remembering the hostname,
 * logging in, and hunting for the screen. With the link it is one tap to
 * /admin/jobs, where the run log, the error and the "try again" button are.
 *
 * ── WHY TELEGRAM AND NOT AN IN-APP NOTIFICATION ──
 *
 * `src/lib/notify.ts` writes notifications for employees to see when they
 * next open the app. That is useless for this: the failure that matters
 * most is the one that happens while nobody is in the app, and an in-app
 * notification about the system being broken may need the broken system to
 * be read at all.
 */

/**
 * The chat the alert goes to.
 *
 * ── BLOCKED ON THE OWNER ──
 *
 * This cannot be invented. Telegram will not let a bot start a
 * conversation: the owner must message the bot first, and only then does a
 * chat id exist. So two values are the owner's to supply and nobody
 * else's:
 *
 *   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN       (already read by src/lib/telegram/config.ts)
 *   TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID   (this — the chat or group the alerts land in)
 *
 * Neither is in `.env` today. Everything below is built and tested; with
 * those two set it sends, and without them it FAILS CLOSED AND SAYS SO
 * rather than pretending. A silent no-op here would be the same fault as
 * the `console.log` it replaces, one layer deeper and harder to find.
 *
 * Read from the environment rather than from the settings table on
 * purpose: the alert must work when the database is the thing that is
 * broken. A chat id stored in a row cannot be read during a database
 * outage, which is precisely when somebody needs to hear from the system.
