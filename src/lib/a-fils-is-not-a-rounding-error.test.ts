/**
 * A FILS IS NOT A ROUNDING ERROR.
 *
 * Twenty-seven money columns were stored with TWO decimal places while this
 * product serves Jordan, whose dinar has THREE (`countries.minorUnit = 3`).
 *
 * PROVED IN POSTGRES ITSELF, not reasoned about:
 *
 *     select 2.555::numeric(12,2), 2.555::numeric(14,3);
 *      →         2.56                     2.555
 *
 * Five fils lost on the way INTO the column, every time, silently.
 *
 * AND THE SCREENS WERE ALREADY RIGHT, which made it worse rather than
 * better. `money-decimals.test.ts` holds every screen to the currency's own
 * decimals, so a JOD figure was printed with three confident digits — the
 * last of them invented by a rounding nobody chose. The screen said
 * `2.560`; the truth had been `2.555`; and the figure it would be
 * reconciled against was rounded before anybody could see it.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS GUARD IS A WALK AND NOT A LIST ──
 *
 * The twenty-seventh column is the whole lesson. A sweep over
 * `Decimal(12, 2)` found twenty-six and passed straight over
 * `campaigns.spend`, which was `Decimal(14, 2)` — fourteen digits and two
 * decimals is still two decimals. A list of column names would have had
 * the same hole and kept it.
 *
 * So this reads the SCHEMA and holds every money column to the rule, and
 * the next one is covered on the day it is written.
