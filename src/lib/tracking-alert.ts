/**
 * WHAT THE PERSON CHASING A PARCEL MUST BE TOLD.
 *
 * The tracking list shows where every parcel is. It did not show the two
 * things that make chasing one pointless or wrong:
 *
 *   THE ORDER WAS CANCELLED while the parcel is still moving. She rings
 *   the customer about a delivery that is not happening, and the courier
 *   is still carrying goods nobody is going to pay for.
 *
 *   THE ORDER'S DATA CHANGED — an approved change was written onto it.
 *   The address she is reading, or the amount she is about to quote, is
 *   not the one that was true when she last looked.
 *
 * Asked for in these words: «الطلب بيضوي أحمر إذا ملغي في قائمة متابعة
 * الطلبات، وبرتقالي إذا في تعديل بالبيانات. والبنت المتابِعة مجرد ما
 * تشوف، لازم زر، وبالزر يطلع Pop إنها أدركت الإجراء».
 *
 * AND IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED, NOT DISMISSED. A colour that anybody can turn
 * off teaches people to turn it off. Pressing the button writes who saw
 * it and when, onto the order, beside everything else that happened to
 * it — so «did anyone notice this was cancelled» has an answer.
 *
 * Pure: the screen and the route both read it, and a rule written twice
 * is a rule that disagrees with itself.
