/**
 * ONE BOUNDARY FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM SIDE, AND WHY ONE IS ENOUGH.
 *
 * An `error.tsx` wraps its segment's `page`, `loading`, `not-found` AND
 * every layout nested below it. Placed here it therefore catches:
 *
 *   /                       (system)/page.tsx — the entry redirect
 *   /login /register        the sign-in screens
 *   /forgot-password /reset-password /pending /entry
 *   (system)/not-found.tsx  the dashboard's own 404
 *   (shell)/layout.tsx      requireShellContext — session, country, store
 *   and every contract screen under it: orders, finance, inventory,
 *   manufacturing, ops, control, growth, customers, products, store,
 *   admin, apps, assistant, confirmation, dashboard, settings.
 *
 * That is roughly a hundred and twenty screens behind one file, and a file
 * per screen would be a hundred and twenty copies of the same sentence to
 * keep in step.
 *
 * WHY NOT A SECOND ONE INSIDE `(shell)`, WHICH WOULD KEEP THE SIDEBAR. It
 * was considered and refused. `(shell)/layout.tsx` awaits
 * `requireShellContext()`, which resolves the session and the country and
 * store selection — the likeliest throw site on the whole system side — and
 * a boundary inside `(shell)` cannot catch its own layout. So the file here
 * would be needed regardless, and the second one would differ from it only
 * in whether the navigation survives. Two pages saying the same thing, one
 * of which drifts. This one draws its own way back instead, so it does not
 * depend on a sidebar it may not have.
 *
 * AND IT DOES NOT WRAP ITSELF IN `SystemFrame`. Next renders `error.tsx`
 * INSIDE the layout of its own segment, and `(system)/layout.tsx` is where
 * `SystemFrame` already is — the stylesheet, the two font families and the
 * person's chosen theme are in scope on this element. A second frame here
 * would nest a theme attribute inside itself and link the system's nine
 * faces a second time. (The sibling `not-found.tsx` does wrap one; it is
 * the belt-and-braces of an older change, not a thing to copy.)
