/**
 * POST /api/auth/2fa/verify — the second factor, and then the session.
 *
 * SIX DIGITS ARE A MILLION GUESSES, AND A MILLION IS NOT MANY. A code lives
 * ninety seconds across the accepted window, so an unthrottled endpoint is a
 * few hours of traffic away from being opened by a script. The limit is per
 * user AND per address: per address alone lets a botnet spread the guessing,
 * and per user alone lets one address grind through every account.
 *
 * The session is issued by `issueSession`, the same function the plain login
 * uses — including the `tokenVersion` bump that makes an account work on one
 * device at a time. A second copy of that here is where the bump would one
 * day go missing.
