/**
 * THE CART QUOTES WHAT THE DOOR WILL CHARGE — OR IT IS LYING TO A SHOPPER.
 *
 * `/api/public/stores/[store]/quote` exists for exactly one reason: a cart
 * holds identities and counts, never prices, so the page has to ask the
 * server what the basket costs. Its own file comment promised «the same
 * answer the order will give … called the same way with the same inputs».
 *
 * It was not. Commit 448ba22 taught `createPublicOrder` to pass the offer's
 * `discount` to `computeCod`; this door was not taught. An offer with
 * `sellingPrice: 25`, `discount: 3`, `quantity: 2` and one pick:
 *
 *   the cart said      25
 *   the order charged  22
 *
 * In the customer's favour, which is why nothing screamed — and still a lie,
 * because a cart that disagrees with the waybill is the one number a shopper
 * decides on. The comment claiming parity was the dangerous half: the next
 * reader trusts it and stops looking.
 *
 * WHAT WAS CHECKED BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING. `discount` is an ABSOLUTE
 * amount, not a percentage — `allocateDiscount` clamps it with
 * `Math.min(discount, subtotal)` and `offers.ts` validates it as
 * `money(1_000_000)`. And it is `basketDiscount` from `public-order.ts` that
 * is imported here, not a second copy of that logic: the dedupe-by-offer-id
 * rule is the behaviour being matched, and two copies of it would agree on
 * the day the second was written and disagree after.
