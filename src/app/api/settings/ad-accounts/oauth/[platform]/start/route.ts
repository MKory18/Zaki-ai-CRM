/**
 * GET /api/settings/ad-accounts/oauth/:platform/start
 *
 * Sends the seller to the platform's consent screen. A GET because it ends
 * in a redirect a browser follows — a POST could not be a link, and a form
 * posting to a third party is the shape phishing takes.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY EACH REFUSAL IS ITS OWN ANSWER ──
 *
 * An unsupported platform is 404: the path named something that is not one
 * of the three.
 *
 * A platform with no APP CONFIGURED is 503 with the env var names and where
 * to register — not 404 and not 500. The distinction matters because the
 * fix is an administrator's, not a seller's, and «not configured» is the
 * only message that leads anybody to it. The screen reads this and draws a
 * sentence instead of a button, so this path is normally unreachable; it
 * exists because a button can be clicked faster than a screen can refresh.
