/**
 * GET /api/settings/ad-accounts/oauth/:platform/callback
 *
 * Where the platform sends the browser back, carrying a `code`.
 *
 * ── IT ENDS IN A REDIRECT, NOT IN JSON ──
 *
 * A person is looking at this: they pressed «sign in», approved a consent
 * screen, and are now waiting. JSON in the address bar is what a developer
 * gets; a settings screen with a sentence on it is what a seller needs. So
 * every outcome — including every refusal — lands back on the settings
 * page with a short code in the query, and the screen turns that into
 * Arabic.
 *
 * The code goes in the query and nothing else does. Not the token, not the
 * error from the platform, not the state: a URL is written to logs,
 * proxies, browser history and error reports.
 *
 * ── THE STATE IS WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE ──
 *
 * Without it, anybody holding a `code` for THEIR ad account can hand it to
 * this URL while a victim is signed in, and the token for a stranger's
 * account is stored against the victim's company — whose every spend
 * figure then comes from somebody else's spending. The state says «this
 * company, this store, this platform, minutes ago», signed, and is checked
 * against the session before the code is spent.
