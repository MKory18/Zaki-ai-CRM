/**
 * GET /api/settings/channels/performance — which door brings money that lands.
 *
 * A SEPARATE ROUTE FROM THE CHANNEL LIST, and that is the whole reason it
 * exists. `GET /api/settings/channels` is read by every order-intake form to
 * fill a dropdown, and it is deliberately open to anyone who may create an
 * order. Hanging eight aggregates off it would make every order form wait for
 * a report, and would hand performance figures to a data-entry clerk who is
 * only allowed to see a list of names. So the names stay there, fast and
 * open, and the numbers live here behind `analytics.view`.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE COUNTS ORDERS THAT `channelPerformance` ALREADY COUNTS. That
 * function is the shared attribution engine — the same one the performance
 * screen's moderator and channel tables read — and it already returns
 * brought, confirmed, decided, delivered, returned, the two rates and the
 * revenue, computed with the same revenue definition as the profit screen. A
 * second aggregation here would be a second definition of «delivered», and
 * two screens would start disagreeing about one week.
 *
 * What is added is only what it does not carry:
 *
 *   FAILED deliveries per channel, so a return rate can be taken out of what
 *   the door actually FINISHED with. `doorOutcome` owns that denominator — the
 *   same function the dashboard's company-wide return rate uses — so a
 *   channel's 21% and the shop's 22% are the same arithmetic on different
 *   rows and can never drift apart.
 *
 *   COLLECTED per channel, and shop-wide, so the score can say out loud that
 *   this band is unmeasurable rather than scoring every door zero.
 *
 *   THE ORDERS WITH NO CHANNEL, because every share on the screen is a share
 *   of a total, and a total that silently omits a bucket makes every other
 *   row look bigger than it is.
