/**
 * THE COURIER ACCOUNT'S IDS — AND WHY THE AUDIT'S VERDICT WAS WRONG.
 *
 * `PUT /api/delivery-providers/:id/credentials` read five numeric ids with
 * `z.coerce.number()`, which IS `Number()`: `'0x10'` → 16, `'0b11'` → 3,
 * `'0o17'` → 15, `['5']` → 5, `true` → 1 (all measured here before the
 * refusal is asserted).
 *
 * The audit filed it as «real but low — fails at the courier, not in our
 * books». TWO of the five do not fail at the courier at all:
 *
 *   `originCityId` is sent as `originAddress.cityId` on every shipment
 *   (`couriers/logestechs.ts`, `createShipment`). A valid-but-wrong city id
 *   produces a SUCCESSFUL shipment, with a barcode, for collection from a
 *   city we are not in. Nothing fails; a pickup simply never happens, and
 *   it looks like the courier's fault days later.
 *
 *   `companyId` is the key of our OWN outbound rate-limit bucket,
 *   `paced('logestechs:' + companyId)` — whose own comment says crossing
 *   the courier's limit suspends the account for a working day. That is
 *   wrong on this side of the wire, before their server has an opinion. It
 *   is also a path segment on `/guests/{companyId}/packages/pdf` and on the
 *   `…/packages/cancel` WRITE; what their server does with another
 *   merchant's id is NOT established here and this guard does not need it.
 *
 * The three type ids had NO MINIMUM at all, so a negative stored, and NONE
 * of the five had a ceiling, so `'1e15'` stored. Both are closed.
 *
 * Every case asserts THE ROW HANDED TO PRISMA before the status code.
