/**
 * POST /api/ops/shipments/hold — keep an order out of today's shipment.
 *
 * The customer rings before the parcel joins a batch: "not this week, my
 * brother is travelling". The order is confirmed and correct; it simply
 * must not go out yet.
 *
 * The two alternatives were both wrong. Cancelling throws away a good sale
 * and releases stock somebody still wants. Leaving it alone means it goes
 * out on the next shipment anybody builds, because nothing on the screen
 * says otherwise.
 *
 * NOT the confirmation postpone. That one means "call them back on
 * Thursday" and belongs to the agent on the phone. This means "do not put
 * it in a van yet" and belongs to whoever builds the shipment. One column
 * doing both would make each one lie about the other.
 *
 * ── THE GOODS DO NOT STAY RESERVED ──
 *
 * They used to, and the owner ruled it out: «وما تحجز رصيد الا بعد ما اشيلو
 * من التأجيل وارجعو لانشاء شحنة». A postponement froze its units for its
 * whole length, so a hopeful date took stock off the shelf that a customer
 * ready to buy today could not be sold — decided by somebody who had not
 * spoken to the customer. Now the units go back on sale, and they are taken
 * again when the hold is lifted, against whatever is actually there.
 *
 * The one exception is a parcel already out of the warehouse: its units are
 * packed under this order's name and are not on any shelf. See
 * `lib/shipment-hold`, which owns that question.
