/**
 * THE CREATE DOOR READS ITS NUMBERS THE WAY THE EDIT DOOR DOES.
 *
 * `PATCH /api/production/[id]` — the door that CORRECTS the same four
 * buckets and the same cost lines — has validated them with
 * `numeric-input` since it was written, and `numeric-input.test.ts` names
 * it among «the doors that move money or stock». This door, the one that
 * creates the batch in the first place, validated nothing. The same
 * failure as every other sibling-door miss in this audit: the rule landed
 * on one of a pair.
 *
 * WHAT THE OLD DOOR DID, MEASURED:
 *
 *   · `!quantityProduced || quantityProduced <= 0` is not a number guard.
 *     On the STRING `'abc'`, `'abc' <= 0` is `false` and `!'abc'` is
 *     `false`, so it passed — and `parseInt('abc', 10)` is `NaN`. Prisma
 *     refuses `NaN` for an `Int` column (`PrismaClientValidationError`),
 *     so nothing was stored; what the operator got was a 500 «حدث خطأ
 *     داخلي» where a 400 naming the field was waiting.
 *   · The silent ones are worse, because they DID store. `'5abc'` → 5.
 *     `'3,5'` from an Arabic keyboard → 3. `'1e3'` typed for a thousand →
 *     **1**. And `'0x10'` → 0, so a run with real costs was recorded with
 *     zero units and `costPerUnit` 0 — past a guard whose whole text says
 *     the quantity must be above zero.
 *   · `parseFloat(manufacturingCost) || 0` stored **0** for anything that
 *     is not a number, and that zero is not visible anywhere: it flows
 *     through `batchTotal` into `totalProductionCost` and `costPerUnit`,
 *     and out into every COGS and production-cost report. Same defect as
 *     `82ecac3`'s free product, on the cost side.
 *   · A free-form cost line was `Math.max(0, Number(l?.amount) || 0)`: a
 *     non-numeric amount became 0, and a NEGATIVE amount was silently
 *     CLAMPED to 0. It is refused now, not clamped. A clamp keeps the
 *     batch's own total wrong — understated by exactly what was typed —
 *     and says nothing, so the operator reads a unit cost that is not the
 *     one their input implies. And the four buckets beside it are refused
 *     for a negative, so a clamp here would be one screen with two rules
 *     for the same kind of number, which is what `a-column-has-one-rule`
 *     exists to stop.
 *
 * A ZERO IS STILL STORABLE, everywhere a zero is a real answer: a run with
 * no packaging cost, and a named line whose amount is genuinely nothing.
 * Every column's own default is `0.0`, and that default is declared here
 * once — not re-applied at the write site, which is where `82ecac3` found
 * the eighth vacuous guard.
 *
 * WHAT IS REFUSED THAT USED TO BE ACCEPTED SILENTLY: a blank cost-line
 * label (it was dropped, taking its amount with it), a 31st cost line (it
 * was truncated), and a label past 80 characters (it was cut). The edit
 * door refuses all three. The screen filters blank labels before it sends,
 * so no live caller changes behaviour.

         * left behind by the `storeId` work above. `Product.storeId` is a
         * single column, so one `productId` belongs to one store and this
