/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * AN ORDER WITH NO LINES IS AN ORDER THAT CAN NEVER SHIP.
 *
 * `POST /api/confirmation/winback` raised a real `Order` and not one
 * `OrderItem`. It was the only one of the six order-creation doors that did
 * not — the other five (`POST /api/orders`, `createPublicOrder`,
 * `createTelegramOrder`, `createReplacement`, the AI intake) all write their
 * lines beside the row.
 *
 * What that costs, end to end: `assertReadyToShip` refuses a lineless order
 * BY NAME — «الطلب بلا أسطر — لا يمكن تجهيزه» — and `reserveOrderLines`
 * iterates an empty list, so no stock is ever held. Every win-back offer a
 * customer ever accepted was an order the warehouse could not pick, for a
 * customer the business had deliberately gone back to win. The feature was
 * dead on arrival and no test of the other five doors could see it.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE HELD HERE, and they are different in kind:
 *
 *   1. THE DOOR, by behaviour — the route is driven with a mocked database
 *      and the rows it writes are read back. Values, not names.
 *
 *   2. EVERY DOOR, by enumeration — the sweep at the bottom finds the
 *      `order.create({` call sites instead of listing them, so a SEVENTH
 *      door added tomorrow fails until somebody classifies it. That is the
 *      real shape of this defect: «one of six forgot», which no test of the
 *      six could catch and no list written today can anticipate.
