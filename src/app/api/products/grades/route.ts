/**
 * GET /api/products/grades?ids=… — the grade for the products on one page.
 *
 * A SEPARATE ROUTE FROM THE PRODUCTS LIST, and that is the whole reason it
 * exists. `GET /api/products` is read by the product picker on every order
 * form and by `useProducts` on several screens; hanging a join over every
 * order line off it would make every order form wait for a report. The same
 * split `/api/settings/channels/performance` makes for the same reason: the
 * names stay there, fast and open, and the numbers live here.
 *
 * BY ID LIST, DELIBERATELY. The products list owns the search, the
 * store scope and the unfiled filter; a second route re-deriving them would
 * drift and the grade beside a name would belong to another row. So the
 * screen loads its page and then asks about exactly the rows it is showing.
 * The ids are still filtered through the same `products.view` scope the list
 * uses, because an id in a query string is a request, not a permission.
 *
 * TWO GATES, TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, AND NEITHER IS A 403.
 *
 *   May this caller see how the catalogue PERFORMS? `reports.view` or
 *   `analytics.view` — the pair the performance and landing screens already
 *   use. Without it the row still answers the readiness question, because a
 *   missing price and a missing image are catalogue facts the products list
 *   already shows this caller in its own columns. The score half is then
 *   absent, not zeroed, and the row SAYS it is absent.
 *
 *   May this caller see what the goods COST? `maySeeCost` —
 *   `cost-visibility.ts` exists because this very endpoint once returned the
 *   margin on everything the company sells to anybody who could open the
 *   products screen. Without it the margin band is absent and the score is
 *   out of seventy, which the row prints.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE ASKS A MODEL. Every sentence the screen prints comes out of
 * `product-grade.ts` as a template around an integer counted below.
