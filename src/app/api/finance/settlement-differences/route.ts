/**
 * GET /api/finance/settlement-differences — whose orders arrive short.
 *
 * «أصلاً في إحصائيات على بنت المتابعة: بتقرأ التعليقات الداخلية وبتشوف إذا
 * عملت خصومات.»
 *
 * The person who agreed the discount is the person whose parcels keep
 * arriving a little short of what the order says, and until it is counted
 * nobody can tell a generous agent from an unlucky one — or from a courier
 * shaving a dinar off a hundred parcels.
 *
 * ── WHO A DIFFERENCE IS COUNTED AGAINST ──
 *
 * The person who CONFIRMED the order, falling back to the moderator who
 * brought it. Confirmation is the call where a price is agreed and where a
 * discount is given, so it is the act the difference belongs to. An order
 * nobody confirmed and nobody sourced is counted against nobody rather
 * than against a guess.
 *
 * ── ONE QUERY, AND THE DENOMINATOR IS THE HONEST ONE ──
 *
 * The rate is differences over the person's orders that REACHED A
 * STATEMENT — not over all their orders. An order still in transit has had
 * no chance to differ, and counting it would make anybody with a busy week
 * look careful.
