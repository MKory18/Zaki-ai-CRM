/**
 * ─── HOW MUCH MONEY LEFT: READ BY THE ONE STRICT READER, NOT BY `parseFloat` ───
 *
 * This line was `const value = parseFloat(amount)`, and this file is the one
 * every other numeric fix in this audit was told to copy — so the weakness
 * was being copied with it. `parseFloat` STOPS at the first character it
 * cannot read and returns what it got:
 *
 *     parseFloat('2,500')  →  2       an Arabic-keyboard decimal comma
 *     parseFloat('12abc')  →  12
 *     parseFloat('1e5')    →  100000  (fine, but by accident)
 *
 * So an API client sending `'2,500'` recorded an expense of **2** — and
 * wrote a wallet movement OUT of 2 beside it, in the same transaction, so
 * the books and the ledger agreed on the wrong number. Nobody is told. The
 * old guard below it (`!Number.isFinite(value) || value <= 0`) could not see
 * it either: 2 is finite and positive.
 *
 * `numeric()` is `numeric-input.ts`'s reader, which this repository already
 * uses on every door that moves money or stock. It is stricter than
 * `Number()` as well as `parseFloat`: it refuses `'2,500'`, `'12abc'`, `''`,
 * `'   '`, `null`, `[]`, `{}`, `true` and — the one a hand-rolled `Number()`
 * reader still lets through — `'0x10'`, which `Number` reads as **16**.
 * Reusing it rather than writing a fourth reader is the point: the rule has
 * one home.
 *
 * ─── AND A ZERO IS REFUSED. THE REASON IS THE COLUMN, NOT TASTE. ───
 *
 * `readBasePrice` deliberately ALLOWS a typed 0, so the two doors differ and
 * the difference is argued from the schema:
 *
 *   · `Product.basePrice` is `@default(0.0)`. The column itself says zero is
 *     a value — a sample, a gift, a price not set yet.
 *   · `Expense.amount` is `Float` with **no default**. Nothing in the schema
 *     nominates 0, and the row does not stand alone: this door writes a
 *     paired `WalletMovement` of the same amount in the same transaction,
 *     and the *other* door onto that table
 *     (`finance/wallets/[id]/movements`) declares `z.number().positive()`.
 *     A 0 expense would therefore mint a 0 movement that the only other way
 *     of making a movement refuses by name — one rule, two answers.
 *
 * An expense of nothing is not an expense: no money left the wallet, so
 * there is nothing to subtract from profit and nothing to tie to a drawer.
 * The refusal says so in words rather than through a falsy check.

     * profit engine — computing it here would be a second definition of
     * «delivered revenue», which is the most expensive kind of duplication
     * in this system. But it is only needed if an expense exists at all, and
