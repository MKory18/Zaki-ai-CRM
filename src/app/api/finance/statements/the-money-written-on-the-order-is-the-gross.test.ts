/**
 * `Order.collectedAmount` IS WHAT THE CUSTOMER PAID, FEE INCLUDED.
 *
 * Measured on this database before a line was changed. Statement approval is
 * the column's ONLY writer, and it wrote `SettlementMatch.statementAmount` —
 * which `schema.prisma:2304` defines as «the NET: what the courier hands over
 * after keeping their fee». The column itself is documented one table over as
 * «what the customer actually paid at the door, and it INCLUDES the full
 * delivery fee».
 *
 * Documented gross, written net, and read by two places that each got a
 * different thing wrong:
 *
 *   `expectedAmountFor` does `collected − fee`, so every settled order's
 *   expectation came out one fee SHORT. Twelve live orders, 2.5 each.
 *
 *   Revenue is `SUM(collectedAmount)` for orders that have one PLUS
 *   `SUM(totalAmount)` for orders that do not. `totalAmount` is gross. So the
 *   two halves of one sum were measured in different units — twelve orders
 *   counted at 231.00 where the gross is 261.000. **Thirty dinars of revenue
 *   nobody spent**, and the same gap in every attribution figure.
 *
 * The arithmetic is asserted below rather than the source alone, because a
 * name is not a behaviour — and the source check that remains is pinned ABSENT
 * rather than merely unused, so the net cannot creep back.

 * every number below green, and only the source assertion at the bottom
 * fired. A test of a copy of the arithmetic is a test of the copy.
 *
 * So the literal right-hand side of `amountOf`'s mapping is read out of the
