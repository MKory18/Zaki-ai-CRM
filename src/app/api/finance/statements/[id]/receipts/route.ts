/**
 * POST /api/finance/statements/:id/receipts — step 2 of settlement.
 *
 * MANY receipts per statement, each with its own wallet, currency and
 * amount: a courier pays part in cash and part by transfer, and that has to
 * be recordable as it happened. No money moves yet — the wallet movement is
 * written when the statement is APPROVED.
 *
 * ── WHY A REPEAT IS THE DANGEROUS CASE, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE GUESSED ──
 *
 * Because many receipts per statement are legitimate, two identical ones —
 * same wallet, same amount, seconds apart — are indistinguishable from a
 * courier paying 50 twice. Nothing on the server can tell a genuine second
 * payment from a double-click or a retried request, so the CALLER says
 * which it is: it generates one id per attempt and reuses it on every
 * retry of that attempt. A replay lands on the row that is already there.
 *
 * The id is the receipt's own primary key, so the uniqueness is the one the
 * database already enforces — no second key to keep in step with it.
