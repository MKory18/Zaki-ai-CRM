 * What each product earned, and what it cost to earn it.
 *
 * It used to sum `orders.totalRevenue` and `orders.netProfit` — a family of
 * financial-snapshot columns that nothing in the system has ever written.
 * Zero of a hundred and fifty-two orders carried a value, so every product
 * reported a revenue of zero, which is presumably why no screen was ever
 * pointed at it.
 *
 * It now asks the same function the dashboard asks. One profit calculation,
 * reading the columns that actually hold money, split across an order's
 * lines so a product is credited with what it sold rather than with whatever
 * happened to be first on the order.

     *   · there was NO LOWER CLAMP, so **`?limit=-5` reached `.slice(0, -5)`
     *     and dropped the last five products from a profit report** — no
     *     crash, no write, a quietly wrong answer.
