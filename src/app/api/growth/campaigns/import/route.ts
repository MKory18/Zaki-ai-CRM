/**
 * POST /api/growth/campaigns/import — pull the campaigns themselves.
 *
 * The sibling route next door pulls what each campaign SPENT, and it could
 * only ever do that for campaigns somebody had already typed in here and
 * matched by hand. This one brings the campaigns.
 *
 * ── THE SAME GATE AS THE CREATE FORM, AND I ALMOST GOT THIS WRONG ──
 *
 * This creates rows, each carrying a campaign code stamped into order
 * numbering from then on, so my first instinct was a stricter permission
 * than `/sync`'s — something like `campaigns.manage`.
 *
 * There is no such permission, and `POST /api/growth/campaigns` — typing a
 * campaign in by hand, the identical act — is gated on `reports.view` with
 * an `analytics.view` fallback. Inventing a permission so that the fast way
 * is harder than the slow way would be INVENTING POLICY, which is not this
 * route's to invent. Import is the create form done in bulk, so it asks for
 * exactly what the create form asks for.
 *
 * ── AND IT IS RATE LIMITED, WHICH `/sync` DOES NOT NEED TO BE ──
 *
 * A spend sync run twice writes the same figures twice. This one talks to
 * three third-party APIs and then writes rows, and a held button would be a
 * queue of `listCampaigns` calls against a rate limit the seller does not
 * control — losing the account to an `ERROR` status for everyone.
 *
 * Import is IDEMPOTENT by construction (it matches on `externalId` and
 * creates only what is missing), so the limit is about the platforms, not
 * about duplicate rows.
