/**
 * WHAT A SCREEN SAYS WHEN IT HAS NOTHING.
 *
 * Eighty-two of them, written one at a time across sixty-three files, and
 * almost all of them said the same non-sentence: «لا توجد بيانات». That
 * tells somebody standing in a warehouse exactly nothing. Is the list empty
 * because the filter is narrow, because nobody has created one yet, because
 * this account cannot see them, or because the request failed?
 *
 * So an empty state answers three questions and no more:
 *
 *   WHAT is missing — named, in the words of the work, not «بيانات».
 *   WHY it is missing — which is usually the filter, and usually the fix.
 *   THE ONE THING that changes it, as a control you can press right here.
 *
 * No illustration. A drawing of an empty box is a drawing somebody has to
 * scroll past every time the filter is narrow, and it never once told them
 * which filter.
