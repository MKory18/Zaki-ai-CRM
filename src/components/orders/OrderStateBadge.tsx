 * Kept as a name, not as a second implementation.

 * Arabic words and CSS classes — was a SECOND copy of something
 * `order-state.ts` already said, and the two had drifted: six states were
 * spelled differently depending on which screen you were looking at. The
 * words and the tones now come from that one place, and the chip that draws
 * them is `ui/StatusChip`.
 *
 * The cancellation split lives there too. It is the one thing this badge
 * ever decided that was worth deciding.
