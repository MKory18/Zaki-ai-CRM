/**
 * /confirmation/follow-up — «المتابعة»: THE ORDERS TO CALL AGAIN LATER, IN TWO KINDS.
 *
 * «الطلبات المؤجلة» and «استرجاع الملغى» were two paged lists built from the same
 * kit, and both mean «call this customer again later». The owner (24/10) kept
 * both lists but wanted the difference to be impossible to miss, so they are two
 * tabs of one screen, named for what they ARE:
 *
 *   · «مؤجلة» — orders somebody promised to call back (a day set by the customer);
 *   · «ملغاة سابقاً» — orders that were cancelled for a reason that fades with time
 *     or price, offered again with a new price.
 *
 * It is the SUPERVISOR's screen (`confirmation.supervise`): the postponed tab
 * carries the filter by agent, and the other kind is a discount, which is money.
 * An agent sees HER postponed orders as a tab of «طلباتي» — the same component,
 * drawn there — so nobody is shown the same list twice.
 *
 * Nothing about either list changed: the same components, the same doors
 * (`/api/confirmation/postponed`, `/api/confirmation/winback`) and the same
 * permission each of them asks. Only where they are drawn.
