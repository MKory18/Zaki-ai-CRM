/**
 * A CLEARED COUNT BOX IS NOT A SHELF WITH NOTHING ON IT.
 *
 * This is the same defect `509306a` removed from the production screen,
 * standing in the one place where the number it invents is a WRITE-OFF.
 *
 *     const [countedQuantity, setCountedQuantity] = useState(0);
 *     onChange={(e) => setCountedQuantity(parseInt(e.target.value, 10) || 0)}
 *     const difference = countedQuantity - systemQty;
 *     <Button disabled={difference === 0 || reason.trim().length < 3}>
 *
 * WHAT THAT PRODUCED, measured below rather than reasoned about:
 *
 *   The screen chooses the first product the moment `/api/inventory`
 *   answers — `if (data.stockSummary?.length > 0 && !productId)`. So the
 *   dialog opens with a product already selected, a system balance of 480,
 *   and a counted quantity of **0 that nobody typed**. `difference` is
 *   -480, which is not zero, so the only thing between that and the wire
 *   is three characters of reason. Type a reason and press save: 480 units
 *   leave the shelf, FIFO-costed out of the oldest batch, with «counted 0
 *   and the system says 480» written into the movement log as though a
 *   person had stood in the warehouse and counted nothing.
 *
 * AND THE DOOR CANNOT HELP. `countedQuantity: count(1_000_000)` has a
 * minimum of 0 — correctly, because an empty shelf is a real count. So the
 * browser is the only place where «I counted zero» and «I typed nothing»
 * are still distinguishable, and `|| 0` is where that distinction was
 * destroyed. This is the rule the repository already carries: when a falsy
 * value is a real value, the fallback is DELETED, not replaced with `??`.
 *
 * The box therefore holds CHARACTERS, the difference panel refuses to do
 * arithmetic on a box that says nothing, and the save button cannot be
 * reached until a quantity exists. A typed `0` still works and still
 * writes off the shelf — that is the whole point of the screen.
