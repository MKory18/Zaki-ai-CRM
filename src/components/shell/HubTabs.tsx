/**
 * THE OTHER SCREENS OF THE SAME ERRAND, ABOVE THE ONE YOU ARE ON.
 *
 * The menu used to spend one line on every screen — fifty-four of them — and
 * the owner's word for it was «كثييير معجوق». A group is now ONE line in the
 * sidebar (see `NavGroup.hub`), and this is where its screens went: a strip
 * of pills above whichever of them is open, so the sibling is one tap away and
 * nobody has to remember which line to open to find it.
 *
 * ── IT IS LINKS, NOT STATE ──
 *
 * Each pill is the screen's own address. Nothing moved: the page guard, the
 * title, the guide, the notification that points at it and the bookmark in
 * somebody's browser all still mean the screen they meant. A pill that were a
 * tab inside one page would have needed redirects for every old address and
 * a second place to enforce who may open what; a link needs neither.
 *
 * ── AND IT NEVER OFFERS WHAT THE PERSON MAY NOT OPEN ──
 *
 * It draws from the groups the shell hands down — the menu this person
 * actually has: stripped of what they may not open, in the order they put it
 * in. A refused screen is not a greyed pill; it is not there, and if its
 * address is typed the server still refuses it.
 *
 * ── THE ROAD LIVES HERE TOO ──
 *
 * On the road groups (الشحن, المال) the pills carry their step — «3. دفعات
 * الشحن» — and the strip ends with «التالي: …». That is what the one-line road
 * strip used to say above these screens; it is gone, because a strip that
 * already shows every stop, numbered, with the one you are on lit, would have
 * printed the same fact twice, one line above the other.
 *
 * A group of cards (the settings) has no strip: twelve pills would be the same
 * clutter one row higher. It carries a single link back to its front door.
 *
 * ── ON A PHONE THE STRIP SCROLLS SIDEWAYS, AND OPENS ON YOUR PILL ──
 *
 * Five pills do not fit across 390px, so the strip scrolls. A strip that
 * always starts at its first pill hides the one you are standing on whenever
 * it is the fourth of five — which is the pill a person looks for first — so
 * the lit one is brought to the middle after every navigation. «التالي» does
 * not squeeze in beside the pills either: when it does not fit it wraps to the
 * line below, and on a desk it stays at the far end of the same row.
