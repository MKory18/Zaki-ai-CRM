/**
 * WHAT IS WAITING FOR ME, AT THE TOP OF EVERY SCREEN.
 *
 * This replaces the single confirmation counter rather than standing beside
 * it. That counter was the right idea applied to one role: a shipping clerk
 * with forty parcels ready to go, a warehouse with a pallet of returns
 * nobody has counted in, and an owner with change requests past their
 * deadline all saw a header identical to each other's.
 *
 * The server still decides which numbers a person gets, by permission, and
 * a count is never a list — the rule that counter was written with, kept.
 *
 * ONE ON A PHONE, THREE ON A DESK. «Seven controls in a 375px bar is how a
 * bell gets missed and a logout gets hit» is this header's own comment
 * about itself, and it is right: the phone gets the single most urgent
 * thing and the rest are one tap away in the palette.
 *
 * AND A ZERO IS NOT NEWS. Showing «0 مرتجع» teaches people to stop reading
 * the row, and then the day it says 14 nobody sees it.
