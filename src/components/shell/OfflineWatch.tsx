/**
 * REGISTERING THE WORKER, AND SAYING WHEN THE LINE IS DOWN.
 *
 * The banner exists because of what the service worker deliberately does
 * NOT do. It queues nothing: a confirmation, a shipment or a cash movement
 * attempted with no signal fails there and then, and is not sent later.
 *
 * That is the right behaviour — replaying a forty-minute-old tap against a
 * world that has moved is how money gets written by accident — but it is
 * only safe if the person KNOWS. Somebody who believes their tap was "saved
 * for later" will not redo it, and the thing they meant to do simply never
 * happens. So the bar says both halves: the line is down, and nothing is
 * being kept.
 *
 * It sits at the top, above everything, and does not wait to be dismissed.
