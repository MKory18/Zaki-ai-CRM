/**
 * The units that were handed to customers and never left stock.
 *
 * Delivering an order was supposed to consume its goods. It never did: the
 * reservation was released the moment the order left the open set, the batch
 * kept its full remainder, and the unit went quietly back on sale. The
 * delivery path now consumes properly — this settles what happened before.
 *
 *   node --import tsx scripts/backfill-delivered-stock.ts           # look
 *   node --import tsx scripts/backfill-delivered-stock.ts --apply   # settle
 *
 * It is safe to run twice. Every order it settles gets a SALE movement
 * carrying that order's id, and an order that already has one is skipped —
 * the same key the live delivery path uses, so the two can never
 * double-count each other.
